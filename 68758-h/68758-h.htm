</div>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE IMPERIAL THEATER</span></h2>

<p>Although it was not yet six o’clock, the November
night had descended upon Paris&mdash;especially in
those meaner quarters on the left bank of the Seine,
where, in 1804, lights were still scarce. However,
three yellow flickering lamps hung upon a rope
stretched across the narrow Rue du Chat Noir.
In this street of the Black Cat the tall old rickety
houses loomed darkly in the brown mist that
wrapped the town and shut out the light of the
stars.</p>

<p class="p2b">Short as well as narrow, the Rue du Chat Noir
was yet a thoroughfare connecting two poor, but
populous quarters. The ground floor of the chief
building in the street was ornamented with a row
of gaudy red lamps, not yet lighted, and above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>them, inscribed among some decaying plaster ornaments,
ran the legend:</p>

<div class="box2">
<p class="center no-indent">THE IMPERIAL THEATER.<br />
DUVERNET, MANAGER.</p></div>

<p class="p2">Imperial was a great word in Paris in the month
of November, 1804.</p>

<p>Across the way from the theater, at the corner
where the tide of travel turns into the little street,
stood Cartouche, general utility man in the largest
sense of the Imperial Theater, and Mademoiselle
Fifi, just promoted to be leading lady. The three
glaring, swinging lamps enabled Cartouche to see
Fifi’s laughing face and soft shining eyes as he
harangued her.</p>

<p>“Now, Fifi,” Cartouche was saying sternly,
“don’t get it into your head, because you have become
Duvernet’s leading lady, with a salary of
twenty-five francs the week, that you are Mademoiselle
Mars at the House of Molière, with the
Emperor waiting to see you as soon as the curtain
goes down.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” promptly replied Fifi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“And remember&mdash;no flirtations.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Cartouche!”</p>

<p>“No flirtations, I say. Do you know why Duvernet
made you his leading lady instead of Julie
Campionet?”</p>

<p>“Because Julie Campionet can no more act than
a broomstick, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. It is because Duvernet saw
that Julie was going the way of his three former
leading ladies. They have each, in turn, succeeded
in marrying him, and there are three divorce cases
at present against Duvernet, and he does not
know which one of these leading ex-ladies he is
married to, or if he is married at all; and here is
Julie Campionet out for him with a net and a lantern.
So Duvernet told me he must have a leading
lady who didn’t want to marry him, and I said:
‘Promote Fifi. She doesn’t know much yet, but
she can learn.’”</p>

<p>“Is it thus you speak of my art?” cried Fifi,
who, since her elevation, sometimes assumed a very
grand diction, as well as an air she considered
highly imposing.</p>

<p>“It is thus I speak of your art,” replied Cartouche
grimly&mdash;which caused Fifi’s pale, pretty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>cheeks to color, and made her shift her ground as
she said, crossly:</p>

<p>“Everybody knows you lead Duvernet around
by the nose.”</p>

<p>“Who is ‘everybody’?”</p>

<p>“Why, that hateful Julie Campionet, and myself,
and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is the first thing I ever knew you and Julie
Campionet to agree on yet&mdash;that the two of you
are ‘everybody’. But mind what I say&mdash;no flirtations.
Duvernet beats his wives, you know; and
you come of people who don’t beat their wives,
although you are only a little third-rate actress
at a fourth-rate theater.”</p>

<p>Fifi’s eyes blazed up angrily at this, but it did
not disturb Cartouche in the least.</p>

<p>“And you couldn’t stand blows from a husband,”
Cartouche continued, “and that’s what the women
in Duvernet’s class expect. Look you. My father
was an honest man, and a good shoemaker, and
kind to my mother, God bless her. But sometimes
he got in drink and then he gave my mother a
whack occasionally. Did she mind it? Not a bit,
but gave him back as good as he sent; and when
my father got sober, it was all comfortably made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>up between them. But that is not the way with
people of your sort&mdash;because you are not named
Chiaramonti for nothing.”</p>

<p>“It seems as if I were named Chiaramonti for
nothing, if I am, as you say, only a little third-rate
actress at a fourth-rate theater,” replied Fifi,
sulkily.</p>

<p>To this Cartouche answered only:</p>

<p>“At all events, there’s no question of marrying
for you, Fifi, unless you marry a gentleman, and
there is about as much chance of that, as that pigs
will learn to fly.”</p>

<p>“So, I am to have neither lover nor husband, no
flirtations, no attachments&mdash;” Fifi turned an angry,
charming face on Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Cartouche,” said Fifi, after a pause, and examining
Cartouche’s brawny figure, “I wish you
were not so big&mdash;nor so overbearing.”</p>

<p>“I dare say you wish it was my arm instead of
my leg that is stiff,” said Cartouche.</p>

<p>He moved his right leg as he spoke, so as to
show the stiffness of the knee-joint. Otherwise he
was a well-made man. He continued, with a grin:</p>

<p>“You know very well I would warm the jackets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>of any of these scoundrels who hang about the
Imperial Theater if they dared to be impudent to
you, because I regard you as a&mdash;as a niece, Fifi,
and I must take care of you.”</p>

<p>Cartouche had a wide mouth, a nose that was
obstinacy itself, and he was, altogether, remarkably
ugly and attractive. Dogs, children and old
women found Cartouche a fascinating fellow, but
young and pretty women generally said he was a
bear. It was a very young and beautiful woman,
the wife of the scene painter at the Imperial Theater,
who had called attention to the unlucky similarity
between Cartouche’s grotesque name and that
of the celebrated highwayman.</p>

<p>Cartouche had caught the scene painter’s wife
at some of her tricks and had taken the liberty of
giving a good beating to the gentleman in the case,
while the scene painter had administered a dose out
of the same bottle to the lady; so the promising little
affair was nipped in the bud, and the scene
painter’s wife frightened into behaving herself.
But she never wearied of gibing at Cartouche&mdash;his
person, his acting, everything he did.</p>

<p>In truth, Cartouche was not much of an actor,
and was further disqualified by his stiff leg. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>the Imperial Theater could scarcely have got on
without him. He could turn his hand to anything,
from acting to carpentering. He was a terror to
evil-doers, and stood well with the police. Duvernet,
the manager, would rather have parted with his
whole company than with Cartouche, who received
for his services as actor, stage manager, and Jack
of all trades the sum of twenty-two francs weekly,
for which he worked eighteen hours a day.</p>

<p>The worst of Cartouche was that he always meant
what he said; and Fifi, who was naturally inclined
to flirtations, felt sure that it would not be a safe
pastime for her, if Cartouche said not. And as for
marrying&mdash;Cartouche had spoken the truth&mdash;what
chance had she for marrying a gentleman? So
Fifi’s dancing eyes grew rueful, as she studied
Cartouche’s burly figure and weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>The night was penetratingly damp and chill, and
Fifi shivered in her thin mantle. The winter had
come early that year, and Fifi had taken the money
which should have gone in a warm cloak and put
it into the black feathers which nodded in her hat.
Pity Fifi; she was not yet twenty.</p>

<p>Cartouche noted her little shiver.</p>

<p>“Ah, Fifi,” he said. “If only I had enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>money to give you a cloak! But my appetite is
so large! I am always thinking that I will save
up something, and then comes a dish of beans and
cabbage, or something like it, and my money is all
eaten up!”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Cartouche,” cried Fifi, laughing,
while her teeth chattered; “I have twenty-five
francs the week now, and in a fortnight I can buy
a cloak. Monsieur Duvernet asked me yesterday
why I did not pawn my brooch of brilliants and
buy some warm clothes. I posed for indignation&mdash;asked
him how he dared to suggest that I should
pawn the last remnant of splendor in my family&mdash;and
he looked really abashed. Of course I couldn’t
admit to him that the brooch was only paste; that
brooch is my trump card with Duvernet. It always
overawes him. I don’t think he ever had an actress
before who had a diamond brooch, or what
passes for one.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Cartouche, who realized that the
alleged diamond brooch gave much prestige to
Fifi, with both the manager and the company.
“However, better days are coming, Fifi, and if
I could but live on a little less!”</p>

<p>The streets had been almost deserted up to that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>time, but suddenly and quietly, three figures
showed darkly out of the mist. They kept well
beyond the circle of light made by the swinging
lamp, which made a great, yellow patch on the mud
of the street.</p>

<p>All three of them wore long military cloaks with
high collars, and their cocked hats were placed so as
to conceal as much as possible of their features.
Nevertheless, at the first sight of one of these figures,
Cartouche started and his keen eyes wandered
from Fifi’s face. But Fifi herself was looking
toward the other end of the street, from which came
the sound of horses’ hoofs and the rattle of a coach
in the mud. It came into sight&mdash;a huge dark unwieldy
thing, with four horses, followed by a couple
of traveling chaises. As the coach lurched slowly
along, it passed from the half-darkness into the
circle of light of the swinging lamps. Within it
sat a frail old man, wrapped up in a great white
woolen cloak. He wore on his silvery hair a white
beretta. His skin was of the delicate pallor seen
in old persons who have lived clean and gentle
lives, and he had a pair of light and piercing
eyes, which saw everything, and had a mild, but
compelling power in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Fifi, quite beside herself with curiosity, leaned
forward, nearly putting her head in the coach
window. At that very moment, the coach, almost
wedged in the narrow street, came to a halt for a
whole minute. The bright, fantastic light of the
lamps overhead streamed full upon Fifi’s sparkling
face, vivid with youth and hope and confidence,
and a curiosity at once gay and tender, and she
met the direct gaze of the gentle yet commanding
eyes of the old man.</p>

<p>Instantly an electric current seemed established
between the young eyes and the old. The old man,
wrapped in his white mantle, raised himself from his
corner in the coach, and leaned forward, so close
to Fifi that they were not a foot apart. One delicate,
withered hand rested on the coach window,
while with an expression eager and disturbing, he
studied Fifi’s face. Fifi, for her part, was bewitched
with that mild and fatherly glance. She
stood, one hand holding up her skirts, while involuntarily
she laid the other on the coach window,
beside the old man’s hand.</p>

<p>While Fifi gazed thus, attracted and subdued,
the three figures in the black shadow were likewise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>studying the face of the old man, around which
the lamps made a kind of halo in the darkness.
Especially was this true of the shortest of the three,
who with his head advanced and his arms folded,
stood, fixed as a statue, eying the white figure in
the coach. Suddenly the wheels revolved, and
Fifi felt herself seized unceremoniously by Cartouche,
to keep her from falling to the ground.</p>

<p>“Do you know whom you were staring at so
rudely?” he asked, as he stood Fifi on her feet, and
the coach moved down the street, followed by the
traveling chaises. “It was the Pope&mdash;Pius the
Seventh, who has come to Paris to crown the Emperor;
and proud enough the Pope ought to be
at the Emperor’s asking him. But that’s no reason
you should stare the old man out of countenance,
and peer into his carriage as if you were an impudent
grisette.”</p>

<p>Cartouche had an ugly temper when he was
roused, and he seemed bent on making himself disagreeable
that night. The fact is, Cartouche had
nerves in his strong, rough body, and the idea
just broached to him, that Fifi would have to go
two weeks or probably a month without a warm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>cloak, made him irritable. If it would have done
any good, he would cheerfully have given his own
skin to make Fifi a cloak.</p>

<p>Fifi, however, was used to Cartouche’s roughness,
and, besides, she was under the spell of the venerable
and benignant presence of the old man. So
she gave Cartouche a soft answer.</p>

<p>“I did not mean to be rude, but something in
that old man’s face touched me, and overcame me;
and Cartouche, he felt it, too; he looked at me
with a kind of&mdash;a kind of&mdash;surprised affection&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Whoosh!” cried Cartouche, “the Holy Father,
brought to Paris by his Imperial Majesty the Emperor
Napoleon, is surprised at first sight into so
much affection for Mademoiselle Fifi, leading lady
at the Imperial Theater, that he means to adopt
her, give her a title, make her a countess or I
don’t know what, and leave her a million of francs.”</p>

<p>Fifi, at this, turned her shapely, girlish back on
the presumptuous Cartouche, while there was a
little movement of silent laughter on the part of
the three persons who had remained in the little
dark street, after the passing of the Pope’s traveling
equipage.</p>

<p>Cartouche had not for a moment forgotten the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>face of the one he recognized so instantly, but seeing
them keeping in the shadow, and having, himself,
the soul of a gentleman, forbore to look toward
them, and proceeded to get Fifi out of the
way.</p>

<p>“Come now,” said he. “It is time for me to go
to the theater, and you promised me you would
sew up the holes in Duvernet’s toga before the
performance begins. It split last night in the middle
of his death scene, and I thought the whole act
was gone, and I have not had time to-day to get
him a new toga; so run along.”</p>

<p>Fifi, for once angry with Cartouche, struck an
attitude she had seen in a picture of Mademoiselle
Mars as Medea.</p>

<p>“I go,” she cried, in Medea’s tragic tone on
leaving Jason, “but I shall tell Monsieur Duvernet
how you treat his leading lady.”</p>

<p>And with that she stalked majestically across
the street and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>One of the group of persons came up to Cartouche
and touched him on the shoulder. It was
the one, at sight of whom Cartouche had started.
In spite of his enveloping cloak, and a hat that concealed
much of his face, Cartouche knew him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Who is that pretty young lady with whom you
have been quarreling?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That, your Majesty,” replied Cartouche, “is
Mademoiselle Fifi, a very good, respectable little
girl who has just been made leading lady at Monsieur
Duvernet’s theater across the way.”</p>

<p>Cartouche, although thrilled with happiness, did
not feel the least oppressed or embarrassed at talking
with the Emperor. No private soldier did&mdash;for
was not the Emperor theirs? Had they not known
him when he was a slim, sallow young general,
who knew exactly what every man ought to have
in his knapsack, and promised to have the company
cooks shot if they did not give the soldiers
good soup? Did he not walk post for the sleeping
sentry that the man’s life might be saved? And
although the lightning bolts of his wrath might
fall upon a general officer, was he not as soft and
sweet as a woman to the rugged moustaches who
trudged along with muskets in their hands? And
Cartouche answered quite easily and promptly&mdash;the
Emperor meanwhile studying him with that
penetrating glance which could see through a two-inch
plank.</p>

<p>“So you know me,” said the Emperor. “Well, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>know you, too. It is not likely that I can forget
the hour in which I saw your honest, ugly face.
You were the first man across at the terrible passage
of the bridge of Lodi.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sire. And your Majesty was the second
man across at the terrible passage of the bridge
of Lodi.”</p>

<p>“Ah, was it not frightful! We were shoulder to
shoulder on the bridge that day, you and I. Your
legs were longer than mine, else I should have
been across first,” the Emperor continued, smiling.
“Berthier, here, was on the bridge, too. We had
a devil of a time, eh, Berthier?”</p>

<p>Marshal Berthier, short of stature and plain of
face, and the greatest chief of staff in Europe,
smiled grimly at the recollection of that rush across
the bridge. The Emperor again turned to Cartouche;
he loved to talk to honest, simple fellows
like Cartouche, and encouraged them to talk
to him; so Cartouche replied, with a broad grin:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty was on foot, struggling with us
tall fellows of the Thirty-second Grenadiers. At
first we thought your Majesty was some little boy-officer
who had got lost in the mêlée from his command;
and then we saw that it was our general, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>a hundred thousand Austrians could not have held
us back then. We ate the Austrians up, Sire.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you ate the Austrians up. Afterward, I
never could recall without laughing the expression
on the faces of my old moustaches when they saw
me on the bridge.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sire, when the soldiers came to themselves
and began to think about things, they were in
transports of rage at your Majesty for exposing
your life so.”</p>

<p>The Emperor smiled&mdash;that magic and seductive
smile which began with his eyes and ended with his
mouth, and which no man or woman could resist.
He began to pull Cartouche’s ear meditatively.</p>

<p>“You old rascals of moustaches have no business
to think at all. Besides, you made me a corporal
for it. One has to distinguish himself to receive
promotion.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” replied Cartouche obstinately,
“we were enraged against your Majesty; and if
your Majesty continues so reckless of your life, it
will be followed by a terrible catastrophe. The
soldiers will lose the battle rather than lose their
Emperor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>The Emperor had continued to pull Cartouche’s
ear during all this.</p>

<p>“And where are your moustaches?” he asked.
“And do you still belong to the Thirty-second
Grenadiers? For they were the fellows who got
across first.”</p>

<p>Cartouche shook his head.</p>

<p>“I did not get a scratch at Lodi, your Majesty;
nor at Arcola, nor Castiglione, nor Rivoli, nor at
Mantua; but one day, I was ordered to catch a
goat which was browsing about my captain’s quarters;
and I, Cartouche, first sergeant in the Thirty-second
Grenadiers, who had served for nine years,
who had been in seven pitched battles, twenty-four
minor engagements and more skirmishes than I can
count, was knocked down by that goat, and my leg
broken&mdash;and ever since I have been good for nothing
to your Majesty. See.”</p>

<p>Cartouche showed his stiff leg.</p>

<p>“That is bad,” said the Emperor&mdash;and the words
as he said them went to Cartouche’s heart. “Luckily
it did not spoil your beauty. That would have
been a pity.”</p>

<p>Both the Emperor and Cartouche laughed at the
notion of Cartouche having any beauty to spoil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“And what are you doing now?”</p>

<p>“I am an actor, your Majesty, at the Imperial
Theater yonder in this street.”</p>

<p>“An actor! You! One of my old moustaches!
What do you know about acting?”</p>

<p>“Well, your Majesty, if you could see the theater,
you wouldn’t be surprised that they let me act
in it. A franc the best seat&mdash;twenty centimes for
the worst&mdash;eating and drinking and smoking&mdash;and
cabbage-heads thrown at the villain, who is
generally an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“But how do you manage on the stage with your
stiff leg?”</p>

<p>“Very well, Sire. I am always a wounded soldier,
or a grandfather, or something of the sort.
And I do other work about the theater&mdash;of so
many kinds I can not now tell your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“And the pretty little girl is your sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“No, your Majesty; I wish she were. She is
not yet twenty, and really has talent; and I am
thirty-five and look forty-five, and have a stiff leg;
and, in short, I am no match for her.”</p>

<p>Cartouche would not mention his poverty, for he
would not that money should sully that hour of
happiness when the Emperor talked with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“What does Mademoiselle Fifi think on the subject?”
asked the Emperor.</p>

<p>“She does not think about it at all yet, your
Majesty. She was but ten years old when I took
her. It was at Mantua. Your Majesty remembers
how everything was topsyturvy in Italy eight
years ago. One day I saw a child running about
the market-place, calling gaily for her mother.
The mother did not come. Then the child’s cry
changed to impatience, to terror and at last to
despair. It was Fifi. The mother was dead, but
the child did not know it then. She had no one in
the world that I could discover; so, when I was
started for France in a cart&mdash;for I could not walk
at all then&mdash;I brought Fifi with me. She was so
light, her weight made no difference, and ate so
little that she could live off my rations and there
would still be enough left for me. When we got
to Paris, I hired a little garret for her, in yonder
tall old house where I live, and Fifi lives there still.
I made a shift to have her taught reading and writing
and sewing, and never meant her to go on the
stage. However, I caught her one day dressed
up in a peasant costume, which she had borrowed,
acting in the streets with some strollers&mdash;a desperately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
bad lot. I carried Fifi off by the hair of
her head&mdash;she had only been with them a single
day&mdash;and frightened her so that I don’t think she
will ever dare to follow her own will again; but I
saw that acting was in her blood, so at last I got
Duvernet, the manager, to give her a small place.
That was a year and a half ago, and to-day she
is his leading lady.”</p>

<p>“And you are not in love with her?”</p>

<p>“I did not say that, your Majesty. I said she
was not my sweetheart; but I wish I were good
enough for her. However, Fifi knows nothing
about that. All she knows is, that Cartouche belongs
to her and is ready to thrash any rogue, be
he gentleman or common man, who dares to speak
lightly to her, or of her, for, although the goat
ruined my leg, my arms are all right, and I know
how to use them.”</p>

<p>“Fifi will be a great fool if she does not marry
you,” said the Emperor.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty means, she would be a great
fool if she thought of marrying me&mdash;me&mdash;me!
Her father was a Chiaramonti&mdash;that much I found
out&mdash;and my father was a shoemaker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>At the mention of the name Chiaramonti the
Emperor let go of Cartouche’s ear, and cried:</p>

<p>“A Chiaramonti! And from what part of
Italy, pray?”</p>

<p>“From a place called Cesena, at the foot of the
Apennines. That is, the family are from there; so
I discovered in Mantua.”</p>

<p>“Do you know her father’s Christian name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty&mdash;Gregory Barnabas Chiaramonti.
I have seen Fifi’s baptismal certificate in
the church at Mantua.”</p>

<p>The Emperor folded his arms and looked at Cartouche.</p>

<p>“My man,” he said, “I shall keep an eye on
Mademoiselle Fifi of the Imperial Theater&mdash;likewise
on yourself; and you may hear from me some
day.”</p>

<p>A sudden thought struck Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Why does not your Majesty go to see Fifi act
to-night? The theater is in this street&mdash;yonder it
is, with the row of red lamps. I put those lamps
up myself. I am due at the theater now, and if
your Majesty has not the price of the tickets with
you for yourself and Marshal Berthier and General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>Duroc”&mdash;for Cartouche knew both of these well by
sight&mdash;“why, I, Cartouche, as stage manager, can
pass you in.”</p>

<p>The Emperor threw back his head and laughed,
and motioned to Berthier and Duroc standing
behind him to come nearer to him.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said to them&mdash;and told them of
Cartouche’s invitation, and accepted it with great
delight.</p>

<p>Marshal Berthier’s homely face lighted up with
a smile at the notion of attending a performance
at the Imperial Theater in the street of the Black
Cat. General Duroc, silent and stolid, followed
the Emperor without a word, exactly as he would
have marched into the bottomless pit at the Emperor’s
command.</p>

<p>“But not a word to the manager until we leave
the house,” said the Emperor.</p>

<p class="p2b">Cartouche, walking with the Emperor, led the
party a short distance up the street to where the
gaudy red lamps showed the entrance to the Imperial
Theater. Duvernet, the manager, in his
shirt-sleeves, was engaged in lighting these lamps.
He called out to the approaching Cartouche.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="illo2"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="350" alt="Napoleon at the Imperial Theater."

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p class="p2">“Look here, Cartouche, this is a pretty business,
if you have forgotten my new toga. You were to
have a new one ready for me to-night&mdash;I can’t
feel like a Roman senator, much less look like one
in that old rag of a toga I wore last night. It
was made out of a white cotton petticoat of Fifi’s,
and she had the impertinence to remind me of it
before the whole company.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” whispered Cartouche to
the manager, coming up close; and then he added,
aloud: “These are some friends of mine, whom
I have invited to see the play as my guests.”</p>

<p>The Emperor, a step behind Cartouche, fixed his
eyes on Duvernet. No use was it for Cartouche to
refrain from mentioning who his first guest was.
Duvernet turned quite green, his jaw fell, and he
backed up against the wall.</p>

<p>“My God!” he murmured. “The toga is a regular
rag!” and mopped his brow frantically.</p>

<p>The Emperor evidently enjoyed the poor manager’s
predicament, and pushing back his hat, revealed
himself so there was no mistaking him.
Duvernet could only mutter, in an agony:</p>

<p>“My God! The Emperor! My God! The
toga!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Duvernet,” said Cartouche, shaking him, “you
behave as if you were drunk.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am&mdash;oh, I must be,” replied Duvernet,
continuing to mop his brow.</p>

<p>“Come, Duvernet,” said the Emperor, laughing,
“never mind about the toga. I am not going to eat
you. I came to see my old acquaintance, Cartouche,
whom I have known ever since we met at the end
of a bridge on the tenth of May, 1796. And, although
I have enough money to pay for myself
and my two friends, I accept Cartouche’s invitation
to see the performance as his guests. He has
promised us the one-franc seats&mdash;don’t forget,
Cartouche&mdash;nothing under a franc.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Sire,” replied Cartouche. “But if
Duvernet doesn’t come to himself, I don’t know
whether we can have any performance or not;
because he is the Roman senator in our play to-night&mdash;a
tragedy composed by Monsieur Duvernet
himself.”</p>

<p>Duvernet, at this, brought his wits together after
a fashion, and escorted the party within the theater,
and gave them franc seats as promised. It
was then time for Cartouche to go and dress, but
Duvernet, not having to appear as the Roman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>senator until the second act, could remain some
time still with his guests.</p>

<p>Afterward Duvernet said that in the half-hour
which followed, the Emperor found out all about
theaters of the class of Duvernet’s, rent, lighting,
wages, and told him more than he had ever known
before about his own business. But Duvernet was
in no way reassured, and his complexion was yet
green, when Cartouche, peeping through a hole
in the curtain, saw him still talking to the Emperor&mdash;or
rather answering the Emperor’s questions.</p>

<p>The house was fast filling. It held only five
hundred persons, and there were but one hundred
seats where the élite of the patronage paid so much
as a franc; and even these seats were filled. Fortune
smiled on the Imperial Theater that night.</p>

<p>Behind the curtain, the agitation was extreme;
the Emperor had been remembered and so had
Berthier and Duroc. Everybody knew that the
Emperor had recognized Cartouche, had walked
and talked with him, had pulled his ear, and had
come to see the performance as his guest&mdash;that is to
say, everybody except Fifi. That grand lady,
since acquiring the dignity of leading lady, always
contrived to be just half a minute behind Julie
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Campionet, her hated rival; but, also, just in time
to escape a wigging from Cartouche. Cartouche
himself, dressed as a centurion of the Pretorian
Guard, was the coolest person behind the curtain,
and was vigorously rearranging the barrels which
represented the columns of the Temple of Vesta.</p>

<p>Julie Campionet, a tall, commanding-looking
woman with an aggressive nose, sailed in then,
arrayed as a Roman matron. After her came Fifi,
tripping, and dressed as a Roman maiden. The
air was charged with electricity, and both Fifi and
the hated Julie knew that something was happening.
Julie turned to the leading man, with whom
she had an ancient flirtation, to find out what was
the impending catastrophe.</p>

<p>Fifi, however, ran straight to the place where
there was a hole in the curtain&mdash;a hole through
which Cartouche had strictly forbidden her to look,
as it was bad luck to look at the house before the
curtain went up. Fifi was terribly afraid of signs
and omens, but curiosity proved stronger than fear.
She swept one comprehensive glance through the
hole, and then, wildly seizing Cartouche by the arm,
screamed at him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Cartouche! Cartouche! It is the Emperor!
Give me my smelling-salts.”</p>

<p>Instead of running for the smelling-salts, Cartouche
shook Fifi’s elbow vigorously.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goose, Fifi! The Emperor has come
here as my guest&mdash;do you understand? And it is
the chance of your life!”</p>

<p>But Fifi, quite pale under her paint, could only
gasp:</p>

<p>“Cartouche, I can never, never act before the
Emperor!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t likely you will ever have but this one
opportunity,” was Cartouche’s unfeeling reply.</p>

<p>“Cartouche, within this hour I have seen the
Holy Father&mdash;and now the Emperor&mdash;oh, what is
to become of me!”</p>

<p>“Get yourself superseded by Julie Campionet,
who has a walk like an ostrich and a voice like a
peacock,” answered Cartouche rudely, “but who
does not go about screaming like a cat because
she has seen the Pope and the Emperor both in one
evening.”</p>

<p>Now, Julie Campionet warmly reciprocated Fifi’s
dislike, and was looking on at Fifi’s doings and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>gloating over the prospect of her failure. Fifi
caught Julie’s eye&mdash;and she would much rather
have been flayed alive than oblige Julie by making
a fiasco; so, instantly, Fifi recovered her composure
and declared she never felt more at ease in
her life, at which Julie Campionet’s spirits sensibly
fell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, everybody, from Moret, the leading
man, down to the old woman who acted as candle-lighter,
treated Cartouche as if he had been a hero.
Moret, who had given himself great airs with Cartouche,
embraced him and told him he would never
be forgotten by the members of the company, for
whom he had procured such an honor. Julie Campionet
would likewise have embraced him, if he
had encouraged her, and did, in fact, come dangerously
near kissing him on the sly, but Cartouche
managed to escape at the critical moment. Duvernet
oscillated between the stage and the theater,
and made so much confusion that Cartouche requested
him to keep away from the stage until his
cue came.</p>

<p>In truth, but for Cartouche’s self-possession, the
Emperor’s presence would have simply caused a terrible
catastrophe at the Imperial Theater, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>manager’s Roman tragedy would not have got itself
acted at all that night; but, by coolness and the
assumption of authority, the curtain came up to
the minute, the play began, and went through without
a hitch.</p>

<p>As for Fifi, she acted as if inspired, and Julie
Campionet saw her hopes of becoming leading lady
vanish into thin air. Duvernet, in spite of two
large rents in the toga made out of Fifi’s petticoat,
was a most imposing senator. In his dying speech,
which bore a suspicious likeness to one of Corneille’s
masterpieces, his voice could be heard bellowing
as far as the corner of the street of the
Black Cat.</p>

<p>The Emperor sat through two whole acts and
applauded vigorously, and when the curtain came
down on the second act, sent for Cartouche, and
paid the performance the highest compliments.
Especially did he charge Cartouche to say that he
thought Duvernet’s death scene the most remarkable
he had ever witnessed on or off the stage. And
then he handed Cartouche a little tortoise-shell
snuff-box, saying:</p>

<p>“It is not likely I shall forget you, Cartouche&mdash;that
is, not until I forget the bridge of Lodi;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>though, really, you should have let me over the
bridge first.”</p>

<p>Cartouche shook his head and spoke no word,
but his stern countenance and his obstinate nose
said as plainly as tongue could speak it:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty should not have been on the
bridge at all.”</p>

<p>The Emperor saw this, and looked significantly
at his companions, who laughed. Then he continued:</p>

<p>“And this young lady, Mademoiselle Chiaramonti,
I shall have some inquiries made about, and
the result may surprise you. Adieu. Remember,
you have a friend in your Emperor.”</p>

<p>This was spoken at the corner of the street of
the Black Cat. Cartouche, with adoration in his
eyes, watched the figure of the Emperor disappear
in the darkness. Then, being careful to note that
there were no onlookers, he kissed the snuff-box,
exactly as he had seen Fifi kiss her paste brooch
when she was enamored with its splendors, and hid
his treasure in his breast.</p>

<p>But Fifi saw it before she slept.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">NUMBER 1313</span></h2></div>

<p>It took Fifi a whole month to recover from the
shock of delight which she had experienced on the
night she had acted before the Emperor. Meanwhile,
her little head became slightly turned, and
she gave herself airs of great haughtiness to Julie
Campionet, and Moret, the leading man, and even
to Duvernet, the manager. Duvernet was one of
those unfortunates who are the victims of their
own charms. He was reckoned a handsome man,
as beauty goes on the left bank of the Seine, and
was almost invincible with young ladies of the
ballet, milliners’ girls and the like. When convinced
that a deserving young woman had fallen
in love with him, Duvernet felt sorry for her, and
honestly tried, by reciprocating her passion, to
keep her from throwing herself in the river.</p>

<p>By virtue of this amiable weakness, he had married
in turn, as Cartouche had said, three of his
leading ladies, and was only safe from Julie Campionet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
as long as Cartouche kept watch, like a wolf,
over the lady. Separations always followed fast
on Duvernet’s marriages, and his three wives were
in such various stages of divorce, that, as Cartouche
said, Duvernet himself did not know exactly where
he stood matrimonially. Of one thing only was he
sure: that Fifi did not harbor designs upon him.
And for this, and on account of her cleverness with
her needle, which enabled her to convert her white
cotton petticoat into a toga for the manager, in an
emergency, Duvernet put up with her airs and
graces.</p>

<p>Fifi tried a few of these same airs and graces
on Cartouche, but Cartouche had the habit of command
with her, and Fifi had the habit of obedience
with him; so these little experimental haughtinesses
on Fifi’s part soon collapsed. Every night, when
the performance was over, Cartouche would bring
Fifi home, and after seeing that she was in her
own little garret, retired to his, which was at the
head of the stairs, and was the meanest and poorest
of all the mean and poor rooms in the mean and
poor lodging-house. But it was respectable; and
to Cartouche, who had charged himself with the
care of such a pair of sparkling dark eyes as Fifi’s,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>and such a musical voice, and such a neat foot
and ankle as hers, this respectability was much.</p>

<p>If he had had his way Fifi would have been locked
up in a convent and only let out to be married to
a person of the highest respectability. But Fifi,
in her own gay little obstinate head, by no means
relished schemes of this sort, and was fully determined
on having both flirtations and a husband,
<i>malgré</i> all Cartouche could say.</p>

<p>The curious part of it was she could not construct
any plan of life leaving out Cartouche. She
had known him so long; he had carried her many
weary miles, in spite of his bad leg, in that journey
so long ago, when Fifi was but a mite of a child;
he had often brought her a dinner when she suspected
he had none for himself; he had taught her
all she knew, and was always teaching her.</p>

<p>The men in the company often spoke roughly to
the women in it, and oftener still, were unduly familiar,
but none of them ever spoke so to her,
chiefly because there was nothing the matter with
Cartouche’s brawny arms, as he had told the Emperor.
And if the man Fifi married did not treat
her right, Cartouche, she knew, would beat him all
to rags; and how could she, husband or no husband,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>settle anything in the world, from a new part in a
play, to the way to make onion soup, without consulting
Cartouche? So the question of a husband
was full of complications for Fifi. At last, however,
a brilliant solution burst upon her mind: she
would have a great many flirtations&mdash;and then she
would marry Cartouche!</p>

<p>Fifi was charmed with her own cleverness in devising
this plan. It occurred to her at the very
moment that she was putting on her hat with the
black feathers to go out and buy herself a warm
cloak. It was Christmas Eve, late in the wintry
afternoon, and she had time, before she was due
at the theater, to run around the corner to a shop
where she had seen a beautiful cloak for thirty
francs. She had saved up exactly thirty francs
in the month since that stupendous evening when
she had seen both the Pope and the Emperor.</p>

<p>The bargain for the cloak was quite completed;
both she and Cartouche had examined it critically,
had made the shopman take off a franc for a
solitary button which was not quite right, and
nothing remained but to pay over the thirty francs.
It was a beautiful cloak, of a rich, dark red, lined
with flannel&mdash;there was one like it, lined with cotton-backed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> satin,
which Fifi longed for&mdash;but when
she mentioned the flannel lining of the first one
to Cartouche, he had promptly vetoed the cotton-backed
satin.</p>

<p>Fifi set forth gaily, feeling warm in spite of her
thin black silk mantle.</p>

<p>It was near dusk and a great silver moon was
smiling down at Fifi from the dark blue heavens.
The streets were crowded and there was as much
gaiety in them as in the finer faubourgs across
the river. The chestnut venders were out in force,
and on nearly every corner one of them had set
up his temporary kitchen, whose ruddy glow
lighted up the clear-obscure of the evening.</p>

<p>Around these centers of light and warmth people
were gathered, sniffing the pungent odor of the
roasting chestnuts, and spending five-centime
pieces with a splendid generosity. The street
hawkers did a rushing business; one could buy
broken furniture, cheeses, toy balloons, cheap bonbons
and cakes tied with gay ribbons, within twenty
feet of anywhere. Three organ-grinders were going
at the same time in front of the brightly
lighted shop where Fifi’s cloak was&mdash;for she already
reckoned it hers. But alas for Fifi! Directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in front of the shop a crowd had collected
around an Italian, who was exhibiting the most
entirely fascinating little black dog that Fifi had
ever seen. He was about as big as a good-sized
rabbit, and was trimmed like a lion. Around his
neck was tied a card on which was written:</p>

<p><i>Toto is my name, and I am a dog of the most
aristocratic lineage in France, and I can be bought
for twenty francs. See me dance and you will
believe that I would be cheap at a hundred francs.</i></p>

<p>Fifi edged her way to where this angel of a dog
was being shown by his owner, the Italian, and
opening her arms wide, cried out in Italian:</p>

<p>“Come here, my beauty. Come here, dear
Toto.”</p>

<p>The dog ran to her, and placing his paws on her
gown, gazed up into her shining eyes with that
look of confiding friendship which only a dog’s
eyes can express. Fifi bent down, and Toto, putting
out a sharp little red tongue, licked her delicate,
cold cheek. Fifi was enraptured. Toto, with
all his beauty, high descent and accomplishments,
was not puffed up, but had a dog’s true heart.</p>

<p>Fifi and Toto became intimate at once, to the
delight of the crowd, as well as of Toto’s master.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>The Italian saw, in this evidence of the dog’s gentle
disposition, a better chance to sell him. A stout,
red-faced woman, showily dressed, immediately offered
eighteen francs for the dog. The Italian
held out stoutly for twenty, and to clinch the
matter, brought out from his clothes somewhere
a complete ballet dancer’s outfit; and in the wink
of an eye Toto was doing a beautiful ballet, his
skirts of pink spangled tulle waving up and down
around his slim, little black legs, a low-necked bodice
showing a necklace around his throat, earrings
jangling in his ears, and his head affectedly stuck
on one side, while he ogled the gentlemen in true
ballet-dancer’s style.</p>

<p>Oh, it was delicious! Fifi almost wept with delight
as Toto pirouetted, his tulle skirts waving
and his earrings tinkling musically. And when at
last he retired and sat down, fanning himself with
his skirts, Fifi’s heart, as well as her hard-earned
money, was Toto’s.</p>

<p>The stout, red-faced woman was obviously impressed
with Toto’s value, for she immediately said
to the Italian:</p>

<p>“Nineteen francs, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>The Italian shook his head; and then, scarcely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>knowing what she was doing, Fifi cried out in her
musical, high-pitched voice:</p>

<p>“Twenty francs! Oh, Toto, you are mine!”</p>

<p>And holding her arms open, Toto jumped into
them and was cuddled to her breast.</p>

<p>It was all over in a minute. The crowd had dispersed,
and Fifi, with Toto in her arms, and his
ballet dress in her pocket, where now only ten of
her thirty francs reposed, was rather dumfounded
at the success of her sudden venture. The cloak,
of course, was out of the question&mdash;and what should
she say to Cartouche? But the touch of Toto’s
little black paws gave her courage, and it was
plain that her love for him at first sight was reciprocated.
So Fifi started back to her garret with
Toto, inventing on the way her replies to the wigging
Cartouche was sure to give her.</p>

<p>She had scarcely got Toto into her room, when a
rap came at the door, which Fifi recognized, and
clapping Toto into the cupboard, she prepared to
face Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cartouche, walking in. “Where
is the cloak?”</p>

<p>Fifi busied herself for a minute in lighting her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>one candle, before she could summon up courage
to answer, in a quavering voice:</p>

<p>“I did not get the cloak, Cartouche. That is,
not to-day.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Cartouche.</p>

<p>“B-b-because I spent twenty francs of the money
upon&mdash;upon something I wanted more than the
cloak.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Cartouche in a tone that
made little shivers run down Fifi’s backbone.
“More feathers? Or was it a fan to keep you cool,
when the snow is on the ground, instead of a cloak
to keep you warm?”</p>

<p>“N-no. It was not a fan. And it is something
to keep me warm, too, it is as good as a stove,
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the note in Cartouche’s
voice. Fifi began:</p>

<p>“It is&mdash;don’t be angry, dear Cartouche&mdash;it is
a little black&mdash;it is a little black&mdash;it is something
alive!”</p>

<p>“Is it a little black ostrich? Or is it a little
black giraffe?”</p>

<p>Cartouche came toward Fifi then, looking exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
as he did the day he caught her acting with
the strolling players on the street.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Cartouche. It is a little&mdash;a little&mdash;I
would much rather have him than a cloak. It is
a dear little&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Toto himself revealed his species at that
moment, by pushing the cupboard door open; and
bouncing out, he ran to Fifi’s protecting arms.</p>

<p>Cartouche was too much staggered to say a
word, but Fifi, in the terrible silence, said timidly:</p>

<p>“He can dance, Cartouche&mdash;and&mdash;and stand on
his hind legs like a little angel!”</p>

<p>“I see,” cried Cartouche, recovering his speech
and uncorking his wrath. “It is for a little black
angel that can stand on his hind legs that you have
sacrificed the cloak!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Fifi, likewise recovering her speech,
now that the murder was out. “Toto is worth a
dozen cloaks to me, and he only cost twenty francs.
It is almost like buying a dear little child for twenty
francs. I shall love Toto so much and he will
love me back&mdash;we shall love each other better than
anything in the world!”</p>

<p>Cartouche drew back a little as if he had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
a blow. He remained silent&mdash;so silent that
Fifi was a little scared.</p>

<p>“You should see him dance,” she said; and slipping
Toto’s ballet costume on him, she began to
sing in a very lively manner:</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><i>Le petit mousse noir.</i></p>

<p>Toto, evidently thinking that he was meant by
the black cabin-boy of whom the song treats, made
his stage bow, and began his ballet dancing. And
as it went on, Cartouche, in spite of himself, began
to laugh. That was Fifi’s triumph&mdash;and springing
up, she, too, began to dance as well as sing.</p>

<p>She was only a half-starved little actress on
twenty-five francs the week. She had no friend
in the world but Cartouche, who was as poor as
she was, but her heart was light, and her fresh
young voice caroled merrily in the cold, bare little
room. Cartouche sat, looking at her, and trying
to frown; but it was in vain. He knew nothing
of that newly-formed resolve in Fifi’s mind, to have
a great many flirtations and then to marry him;
and then, a vast, a stupendous sacrifice came into
his mind by which he could still get Fifi a cloak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>He had ten francs of his own, and there was the
tortoise-shell snuff-box the Emperor had given him.
Cartouche himself would have starved and frozen
rather than take it to the pawnshop&mdash;but Fifi’s cold
and hunger was something else. There was no
struggle in making the resolve, sacrifice for Fifi
was no sacrifice to Cartouche, but there was a moment
of sharp regret&mdash;a feeling that the only
treasure among his poor possessions was about to
be torn from him. Presently he said gently:</p>

<p>“Fifi, I have two bundles of fagots in my room
and a sausage, and I will get a bottle of wine, and
after the performance to-night, we will have a
little supper here. And I will forgive you for buying
Toto.”</p>

<p>“That will be best of all,” cried Fifi, remembering
that in the end she meant to marry Cartouche.</p>

<p>Cartouche went out, leaving Fifi alone, for half
an hour of rapture with Toto, before it was time
to go to the theater. He climbed up to his garret
under the roof, and taking his cherished snuff-box
from his breast where he always carried it, looked
at it as a mother looks her last on her dead child;
and then, going quickly downstairs again into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>street, he made for a pawnshop close by, with which
he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>Just as he turned the corner of the street of the
Black Cat, he almost ran into Duvernet’s arms.</p>

<p>“Hey, Cartouche, you are the very man I want
to see,” cried the manager, buttonholing him. And
then, noting that several persons on the street
stopped and looked at him, Duvernet swelled out
his chest and assumed an attitude in which he very
much admired himself in his favorite part of the
Roman senator.</p>

<p>Duvernet continued in a very impressive manner:
“I contemplate both raising your salary, Cartouche,
and also making you a little gift. You have worked
hard for me; you got the Emperor to the theater,
and business has been remarkably good ever since,
and you have kept Julie Campionet from marrying
me&mdash;so far, that is&mdash;and I feel the obligation, I
assure you. So your salary after this will be
twenty-five francs the week, and here are three ten-franc
pieces which I beg you will accept.”</p>

<p>With the air of a Roman emperor bestowing
a province upon a faithful proconsul, Duvernet
thrust the thirty francs into Cartouche’s hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>Cartouche, thoroughly dazed, mumbled something
meant for thanks as he accepted the three ten-franc
pieces. Duvernet, suddenly dropping his majestic
manner, said, in Cartouche’s ear:</p>

<p>“And remember, you have got to keep Julie
Campionet from marrying me. I don’t like the
look in her eye&mdash;she shows she is bent on it&mdash;and
stop Fifi from reminding me of that infernal white
petticoat she gave me.”</p>

<p>Cartouche nodded, and Duvernet, resuming his
air of benignant magnificence, stalked off, happy.
At least six persons had seen him make this princely
present. His heart was good, although his head
was indifferent, and he was sincerely glad to be able
to reward Cartouche for his faithfulness.</p>

<p>In a minute or two Cartouche came to himself,
and tore along the street, as fast as his stiff leg
would allow, to the cloak shop, where, in two seconds,
he had paid the money for the beautiful
cloak, and had it wrapped in a bundle under his
arm. How happy was Cartouche then!</p>

<p>He still had his ten francs, and he determined to
make a little Christmas feast for Fifi. So he
bought a jar of cabbage-soup, and a little bag of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>onions, and some chocolate. Then he went into a
wine shop for a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>The wine shop was a cheerful, dirty, agreeable
place that he knew well. When he entered he found
the shop full of men, standing around a table on
which was a blindfolded boy with a hat full of slips
of paper in his hand.</p>

<p>A shout greeted Cartouche’s arrival.</p>

<p>“You are just in time, Monsieur Cartouche,”
cried the proprietor, a jolly red-faced man. “You
make the last and twenty-fifth man necessary to
join our lottery. I have bought a ticket in the
Grand Imperial Lottery, which is to be drawn in a
fortnight, and for every bottle of wine I sell, and a
franc extra, I give my customers a chance in the
lottery ticket, limiting it to twenty-five chances.
Come now&mdash;I see good luck written all over you&mdash;hand
me your franc.”</p>

<p>Cartouche handed out his franc, bought his bottle
of wine, and joined the circle at the table. The
little boy handed the hat around, and every man
took a slip out and read thereon a number. Cartouche
took his slip and read out:</p>

<p>“Number 1313!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted this, but when it subsided,
the proprietor advanced, and handing Cartouche
a blue lottery ticket, said gravely:</p>

<p>“You have won, Monsieur Cartouche, in our lottery,
and I hope you will win in the Imperial Lottery.
The number of the ticket I offer you is
1313.”</p>

<p>There was another shout of derision, and several
of the disappointed ones commiserated with
Cartouche on the load of ill luck he was carrying
off with him in number 1313, but Cartouche stoutly
maintained that there was nothing to be afraid of,
and hurried back to the street of the Black Cat.</p>

<p>There was just time for him to get to the theater
and dress. The people came pouring into the
house, and the box office took in the enormous sum
of two hundred and ninety-eight francs. It was
again Duvernet’s Roman tragedy, and it went
finely. Fifi again acted as if inspired, and received
any number of recalls, besides a wreath of holly,
with an imitation silver buckle in it, handed over
the footlights from an unknown admirer.</p>

<p>During the waits between the acts she told her
fellow actors of Toto’s charms and accomplishments,
so that the other women, some of whom possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
nothing more interesting than babies, were
furiously jealous.</p>

<p>But at last the play was over, and Fifi and Cartouche
were in Fifi’s garret, with a good fire in the
stove, made with Cartouche’s fagots, the cabbage-soup,
the onions, the wine, and the sausage, and
the chocolate on the table, and Toto to make the
trio complete. Cartouche had sneaked the cloak
in, without Fifi’s seeing it, and just as they were
sitting down to the table he said carelessly, as if
thirty-franc cloaks were the most ordinary incidents
in life:</p>

<p>“Fifi, if you will open that bundle on the chair,
you will find a little gift from me.”</p>

<p>Fifi ran and tore the parcel open, and there was
the beautiful, warm, crimson cloak. She flew to
Cartouche, and with dewy eyes, although her lips
were smiling, gave him one of those hearty kisses
she had given him when she was a little, black-eyed
damsel ten years old. Cartouche did not
return the kiss, but sat, first pale and then red,
and with such a strange look on his face that Fifi
was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said to herself. “The next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>time it will be he who kisses me&mdash;not I who kiss
him.”</p>

<p>But nothing could spoil the joy over the new
cloak.</p>

<p>“To think that I should have the red cloak and
Toto, too! Oh, it is too much!” cried Fifi.</p>

<p>“Quite too much&mdash;too much by way of a dog,”
remarked Cartouche; but as Toto at that moment
jumped from his chair at the table on to Cartouche’s
knee, it became impossible not to be
friendly with the little rogue, and perfect harmony
reigned among the three friends.</p>

<p>Cartouche and Fifi were among the poorest people
in Paris; they worked hard for a very little
money; the room was small and bare, and although
Fifi had now a cloak for the winter, she would
have been better off for some warm stockings, and
Cartouche for some flannel shirts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were as happy as the birds in
spring. They ate, they drank, they laughed, they
sang. Fifi dressed Toto up in his ballet costume,
and together they did a beautiful <i>ballet divertissement</i>
for Cartouche, which he liberally applauded.
He told Fifi of his twenty-five francs a week, as
well as Duvernet’s present, and Fifi concluded that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>he would be a desirable <i>parti</i> for his money as well
as for his solid virtues, and determined to propose
to him before another year should pass.</p>

<p>Cartouche had forgotten about the lottery
ticket, but just as he was leaving, he remembered
it and handed it to Fifi. At the sight of the numbers
on it, Fifi shrieked:</p>

<p>“Take it away! Take it away! It will bring
bad luck! Take it away!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” replied Cartouche, “and do you, Fifi,
take care of it. You may draw the hundred-thousand-franc
prize in the lottery yet. Just as likely
as not the prizes are put on the numbers that nobody
would choose.”</p>

<p>This somewhat reconciled Fifi to the danger of
keeping number 1313; so she reluctantly put it
away in the box where she kept her treasure of a
paste brooch, remarking meanwhile:</p>

<p>“If it draws the hundred-thousand-franc prize,
I will marry you, Cartouche.”</p>

<p>Again Cartouche turned red and pale. These
jokes which seemed to amuse Fifi so much, cut him
to the quick. He only growled:</p>

<p>“About as much chance of one as of the other.”</p>

<p>And then a great melodious deep-toned bell in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>a neighboring church began its chiming, solemn
and glorious, proclaiming that Christmas Day was
at hand, and Fifi, falling on her knees, as her
mother had taught her long years ago, in Italy,
thanked God for giving her Cartouche, and Toto,
and the red cloak lined with flannel.</p>

<p>She forgot all about the lottery ticket.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE GRAND PRIZE</span></h2></div>

<p>For the first fortnight of the new year, things
went swimmingly at the Imperial Theater, and
several times the nightly receipts were over three
hundred francs. Duvernet wrote and produced
a new play, in which he took the part of Alexander
the Great; and it was a screaming success. Fifi
as Queen Roxana was simply stunning, wearing
her alleged diamond brooch in a tiara made by her
own hands, of beautiful glass beads. The merry
war between Julie Campionet and herself went on
as noisily as ever, but there was more noise than
malignity about it. When Julie was ill with a
cold, Fifi went and cooked Julie’s dinner for her;
and when Fifi needed a scepter for her part of
Queen Roxana, Julie Campionet sent her a very
nice parasol handle with a glass knob at the top
which made a lovely scepter.</p>

<p>But they did not, for these trifles, deny themselves
the pleasure of quarreling, and Duvernet was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>treated about once a week to a threat from each
of them that if her rival were not immediately discharged,
the complainant would at once resign.
Duvernet received these threats with secret satisfaction,
because, as he explained to Cartouche, as long
as the war was actively prosecuted, Julie Campionet
did not have time to make a serious demonstration
against him.</p>

<p>“But if ever they are reconciled,” he confided
gloomily to Cartouche, “the Campionet woman
will marry me in a week.”</p>

<p>As for Cartouche, he attended strictly to his
business at the theater, but his mind was so much
taken up with certain possibilities of the future
that he did not keep the faithful watch over Duvernet
which the manager considered as his safeguard.
Cartouche was even so inconsiderate as
to let Julie Campionet get into the manager’s private
office more than once, and remain there alone
with him for at least five minutes, without interrupting
the tête-à-tête.</p>

<p>It was the lottery ticket which in some way
grievously disturbed Cartouche’s mind. Suppose
Fifi should win a prize? And from that supposing,
came a kind of superstitious conviction that number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
1313 <i>would</i> win a prize. He found himself,
without his own volition, figuring upon what should
be done with the money, so as to enure to the greatest
benefit of Fifi.</p>

<p>“If it is a twenty-franc prize she draws, she must
have a pair of new shoes, and some good stockings”&mdash;he
thought, for Cartouche knew intimately
the condition of Fifi’s wardrobe. “If it is
as much as fifty francs, the shoes and stockings
must wait&mdash;it won’t do to fool away such a sum
as fifty francs; it must be put aside for a rainy
day, for Fifi, in the tin box in the cranny of the
chimney”&mdash;where Cartouche was beginning to
save up also for a rainy day, for Fifi. If it were
five hundred francs&mdash;or possibly a thousand&mdash;Cartouche
lost his breath in contemplation of the catastrophe.
In that case, Fifi would have a <i>dot</i>, but
whom would she marry? She knew no one but the
men about the theater, and Cartouche did not consider
any of them a match for Fifi; but perhaps
he was prejudiced. She might, it is true, with five
hundred francs to her dowry, marry a tradesman;
but how would Fifi get on with a tradesman?</p>

<p>Altogether, it was the most puzzling proposition
Cartouche had ever struggled with, and he began
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>to wish the fateful day were over, and that these
strange dreams and hopes and fears about Fifi and
the lottery ticket would vanish like shapes in a
mist, and leave him in peace.</p>

<p>Then, there was that veiled suggestion from the
Emperor that he knew something about Fifi’s family
which might change her whole destiny; and on
the whole, Cartouche had good reason to go about
looking like a sick bull, which was his way of
showing a passionate solicitude for the being dearest
to him on earth. And meanwhile, Julie Campionet
went hot foot after the manager, and Fifi
wondered why Cartouche was so gentle with her
and so indulgent with Toto.</p>

<p>The lottery drawing was to be held on the tenth
of January, in a large public hall of the <i>arrondissement</i>,
the mayor presiding. The drawing was
to begin at noon, and last until all the tickets were
drawn. As the day drew near, Cartouche’s fever
of excitement increased, and when the morning of
the tenth dawned he was as nervous as a cat. He
knocked at Fifi’s door early, and told her to be
ready to go with him at twelve o’clock to the lottery
drawing. Fifi responded sleepily, but when
the hour came she was ready to accompany him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>It was a lovely, bright morning, and Fifi’s looks
were in harmony with the morning. The red
cloak was very becoming to her, and the black
feathers, for which her first thirty francs had gone,
nodded over the most sparkling, piquant face in
Paris. Toto, of course, was along, led by a long
blue ribbon in his mistress’ hand; and so they
set off.</p>

<p>Fifi had not the slightest thought of drawing a
prize.</p>

<p>“As if 1313 would draw anything!” she sniffed.
“If you had given me that franc, Cartouche, which
the ticket cost, I could have bought a pair of
gloves, or a fan, or a bushel of onions&mdash;” Fifi went
on to enumerate what she could have bought with
Cartouche’s franc, until its purchasing power grew
to be something like her whole weekly salary. But
in any event, she liked the expedition she was on
and Toto liked it; so, on the whole, Fifi concluded
she could at least get fifty centimes’ worth of pleasure
out of the lottery ticket.</p>

<p>She looked so pretty as she tripped along that
Cartouche mentally resolved, if she drew a five-hundred-franc
prize, she might aspire to a notary,
such as her father had been; and engrossed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>the thought of Fifi’s possible rise in the world, he
was so grumpy, Fifi declared she almost hated
him.</p>

<p>They were among the first to arrive, and secured
good seats near the tribune. There sat the officers
of the lottery, the mayor with his tricolored sash,
and several representatives of the government, together
with a little fairy of a child, all in white,
who was to draw the numbers from the wheel, which
was already in place.</p>

<p>The crowd assembled in the hall was an orderly
and well-dressed one, but Fifi and Cartouche, who
were used to crowds, felt in a subtile way that it was
quite different from the ordinary crowd. Most of
the people were, like Cartouche, in a state of acute
tension. They were strangely still and silent, but
also, strangely ready to laugh, to cry, to shout&mdash;to
do anything which would take the edge off the
crisis.</p>

<p>When the drawing began, and one or two small
prizes of twenty and fifty francs were drawn, the
winners were vociferously cheered. There was a
feeling that the grand prize of a hundred thousand
francs would not be drawn until late in the afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
and the people were letting off their excitement
over the little prizes, waiting for the thunder-bolt
to fall. But scarcely half an hour after the
drawing began, there was a sudden, deep pause&mdash;time
itself seemed to stop for a moment&mdash;and then
the auctioneer, who was calling out the prizes,
roared out:</p>

<p>“Number 1313 draws the grand prize of one
hundred thousand francs!”</p>

<p>Cartouche sat stunned. Like persons near
drowning, he saw in an instant, by some inward
vision, all his past and future with Fifi: she was no
more for him. A great gulf had opened between
them. Had it been thundered in his ears for a
century, he could not have realized it more than in
the first two seconds after the announcement was
made. Fifi had a hundred thousand francs; then
she could be Fifi, his little Fifi, no more. He saw,
in a mental flash, the little store he had saved up
in the cranny of the chimney&mdash;twenty-two francs.
Twenty-two francs! What a miserable sum! A
blur came before his eyes; he heard a great noise
of men shouting and clapping; women were waving
their handkerchiefs and laughing and screaming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>out of sheer inability to keep quiet. As for Fifi,
she turned two wide, innocent, frightened eyes on
Cartouche, and stammered:</p>

<p>“Dear Cartouche&mdash;shall we really have a hundred&mdash;thousand&mdash;francs&mdash;of
our own?”</p>

<p>“You will have it, Fifi,” replied Cartouche,
and thrusting the ticket in her nerveless hand, he
forced her to stand up and show it, which Fifi
did, then suddenly burst into a torrent of tears
and a tempest of sobs.</p>

<p>Her youth, her beauty, her tears, her humility
touched all hearts; and this time there was a roar
of sympathy. Fifi’s slight figure swayed and
would have fallen but for Cartouche holding her
up. It was buzzed about on all sides:</p>

<p>“Who is that tall, ugly fellow with her?” Some
said her father, some her brother, but no one said
he was her lover.</p>

<p>The formalities were simple and brief; the
drawing would still take many hours; and Fifi,
with her precious memorandum, duly signed and
countersigned, to be presented at a certain bank,
was once again in the street with Cartouche.</p>

<p>It was a bright, soft January day, the sun gilding
the blue river, the quays and bridges, and lighting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>up with a golden glow the great masses of the
Louvre and the Tuileries. Fifi walked along,
clutching Cartouche’s arm tightly. She had forgotten
Toto trotting soberly at her side, and apparently
crushed by the hundred thousand francs,
forgotten all but Cartouche, who seemed to her the
only thing that was not changed in all the wide
world. It was Cartouche who held Toto’s blue
ribbon and who straightened Fifi’s hat when it fell
over her eyes and she was too agitated to know it.
Cartouche proposed to her to stop and rest in the
Tuileries gardens&mdash;but Fifi would have none of it.</p>

<p>“Take me home,” she cried. “Take me somewhere
so I can cry as much as I like!”</p>

<p>This struck Cartouche as a perfectly natural
way of receiving such stunning news; he himself
could have wept with pleasure.</p>

<p>At last they were in Fifi’s shabby little room,
and Fifi was taking off her new cloak and folding
it up mechanically.</p>

<p>“No need to do that, Fifi,” said Cartouche, in a
strange voice. “After to-morrow you need not
wear thirty-franc cloaks any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you cruel Cartouche!” cried Fifi, and burst
into the anticipated fit of crying. She insisted on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>weeping on Cartouche’s shoulder, and even kicked
Toto when that sympathetic dog would have joined
his grief to hers, for Toto knew well enough that
something was to pay, whether it was the devil
or not, he could not tell, but rather suspected it
was the devil.</p>

<p>Cartouche tried to comfort Fifi&mdash;usually not a
difficult problem when one has to be reconciled to
a fortune&mdash;but there is always something staggering
in contemplating another state of existence.
Neither Cartouche nor Fifi could at once become
calm, and Fifi, too, felt in some singular, but acute
manner, that the hundred thousand francs stood
between her and Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Now, mind, Fifi,” Cartouche said, “not a word
of this to the people in the theater. Wait until
the money is actually in your hands.”</p>

<p>“In my hands,” cried Fifi, tearfully and indignantly,
“in <i>your</i> hands, you mean, you cruel Cartouche!”</p>

<p>Fifi had called Cartouche cruel a dozen times
since she had drawn the prize, but Cartouche did
not mind it. He would have liked to stay with her
but there were a dozen things awaiting him at the
theater, and Cartouche was not the man to neglect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>his work. He went off, therefore, and had not a
minute to himself, until just before it was time to
dress for the play. Then he went to his room,
and taking his tin box from the chink in the chimney,
he counted over his twenty-two francs&mdash;saved
by doing without food and fire.</p>

<p>Clothes and shoes he must have to keep his place
in the theater. Duvernet had been a good friend
to him, and he could not go in rags, so that people
would say: “There goes one of Duvernet’s actors.
That man does not pay his people enough to give
them decent clothes to their backs.”</p>

<p>But food and fire were a man’s own affairs, and,
by keeping on the near side of both, Cartouche had
been able to save twenty-two francs in three weeks
of the coldest weather he had ever felt. And how
little it was! How contemptible alongside of a hundred
thousand francs! Cartouche, sighing, put the
box back. It was all in vain: those days when he
battled with his hunger, those bitter nights when
the snow lay deep on the roofs below his garret, and
his old, cracked stove was as cold as the snow. And
yet, there had been a tender, piercing sweetness in
the very endurance of those privations&mdash;it was for
Fifi. And Fifi would never more need his savings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>which thought should have made him happy, but
did not.</p>

<p>The next day, the whole story was out, the newspapers
published the numbers and names of the
winners, and it was as if Fifi had been transported
to another planet.</p>

<p>Duvernet came first to congratulate her. She
was in a cold spasm of terror for fear he had come
to tell her that her services were no longer needed
at the theater. It seemed to her as if she were
about to be thrown headlong into an unknown
abyss, and she thought that if she could but remain
at the Imperial Theater for a short while longer,
long enough to get accustomed to that stupendous
change which awaited her, it would become a
little more tolerable. And Duvernet himself was
so strange, it frightened Fifi. He was so respectful;
he did not strut as usual, and he called her
Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, instead of Fifi. And
Toto, who usually barked furiously at the manager,
did not bark at all, but sat on his hind legs,
his fore legs dropping dejectedly, and looked ruefully
in Duvernet’s face, as much as to say:</p>

<p>“See, Monsieur Duvernet; we have got a hundred
thousand francs and we don’t know what to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>do with it, or how to behave ourselves.” Toto, in
fact, had neither barked nor danced nor jumped
since he heard the news, and appeared thoroughly
oppressed and abashed by his changed fortunes.</p>

<p>Duvernet, it is true, felt some awe of Fifi in her
new aspect, but the active and enterprising manager
was still uppermost with him.</p>

<p>“Well, Mademoiselle,” he began, trying to assume
an airy manner, “I presume we shall have
to dispense with your valuable services at the Imperial
Theater; you will probably abandon the
stage altogether, and certainly our humble place.”</p>

<p>Duvernet, before this, had always spoken as if
the Imperial Theater were the rival of the Théâtre
Française.</p>

<p>Fifi burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she cried, “I shall have to go away&mdash;and
that odious Julie Campionet, who can no more act
than a gridiron can act, will have all my best parts&mdash;o-o-o-o-oo-h!”</p>

<p>Then Duvernet played his trump card.</p>

<p>“A few farewell performances, Mademoiselle,
would put Julie Campionet’s nose severely out of
joint.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” cried Fifi, brightening up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>at the thought of putting Julie’s Roman nose out
of joint; that, at least, seemed natural and normal.</p>

<p>“If Cartouche will let me&mdash;” for Fifi now, instead
of opposing Cartouche, seemed unable to come
to the smallest decision without him.</p>

<p>“I will see to that,” replied the manager eagerly,
“and I will also see to it that Julie Campionet is
made to gnaw the file.”</p>

<p>Just then Cartouche coming in, Fifi besought
him to let her act for at least two weeks more; and
Cartouche, feeling himself that vague, but intense
strangeness of all things and people since Fifi got
her hundred thousand francs, consented. When it
was decided, Toto laid his nose down on his paws
and uttered a short whine of relief, which sounded
like grace after meat.</p>

<p>So Fifi was to play for two weeks more at the
Imperial Theater, the franc seats were to be two
francs, and the cheapest seats, fifty centimes. Fifi
breathed again. It was a respite.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fifi had been formally notified that
the money was awaiting her at a certain bank, and
she was requested to name a day for the payment
to her, in the presence of an official of the lottery,
a friend of her own, and a representative of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>lottery company. Fifi, or rather Cartouche for
her, named a day a whole month from the day of
the lottery drawing. They were both frightened
at the prospect of Fifi’s receiving the money.</p>

<p>She and Cartouche resumed their life exactly as
it had been before number 1313 was purchased.
Cartouche, going about attending to his business
as usual, thought his head would crack. At the
end of the month, what was to be done? He was
but little more experienced than Fifi when it came
to a hundred thousand francs. Fifi must find another
and a very different home&mdash;but where? She
must be married&mdash;but when and how and to whom?
He knew of no one of whom he could ask advice,
except one, and he was not easy to reach&mdash;the
Emperor. Cartouche was as certain as he was of
being alive, that if he could see his Emperor, and
could tell the whole story, a way out of all his perplexities
could be found. He had a shadowy hope
that the Emperor might have discovered something
about Fifi, according to that mysterious hint he
gave the memorable night when he heard her name,
but it did not materialize.</p>

<p>At last Cartouche formed the desperate resolve
of trying to see the Emperor and telling all his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>trouble about Fifi. On certain mornings in the
week an inspection of the Imperial Guard was
held in the courtyard of the Tuileries; and on one
of these mornings&mdash;a cold, dull, uncertain morning,
matching Cartouche’s feelings&mdash;he went and
stationed himself as close to the iron railings of
the courtyard as the police would let him. He
thought to himself: “The Emperor sees everything
and everybody. He will see me, and he will know
that I have something on my mind, and then he
will send for me, and I will make a clean breast of
it; and the Emperor will tell me what to do with
Fifi and her money.”</p>

<p>The guard was drawn up into a hollow square,
their splendid uniforms making a splash of color
in the dull gray day, their arms shining, their
bronzed countenances and steady eyes fit to face
the great god Mars himself. Presently an electric
thrill flashed through every soldier and each of the
crowd of onlookers, as when a demigod appears
among the lesser sons of men&mdash;the Emperor appeared,
stepping quickly across the courtyard.</p>

<p>He was in simple dress uniform, and had with
him only two or three anxious-looking officers;
for he was then the eagle-eyed general, who knew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>if a button was missing or a strap awry, and incidentally
read the soul of the man before him. At
once, he ordered this man and that to open his
knapsack; one piercing glance sufficed to see in it
and through it. He had a musket examined here
and there, and in a flash he knew if everything
was as it should be. The inspection was rapid,
but nothing escaped the magic eyes of the Emperor.
All was in order, and in consequence, Jove
smiled.</p>

<p>Cartouche saw that the Emperor would pass
within a few yards of him, and he stood, erect and
rigid, at “attention,” waiting for the lightning
glance to find him, and, just as he expected, the
Emperor’s eye swept over the waiting crowd, rested
a moment on him, recognized him instantly, and
as Cartouche made a slight gesture of entreaty,
nodded to him. Five minutes after, a smart young
aide stepped up, and motioning to Cartouche,
walked toward the palace; Cartouche followed.</p>

<p>He did not know how he got into a small room
on the ground floor, which communicated with the
Emperor’s cabinet. He was hot and cold and red
and pale, but said to himself: “Never mind, as
soon as I see the Emperor I shall feel as cool and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>easy as possible. For when was it that a private
soldier was not at his ease with the Emperor? It is
the bigwigs who think they know something, whom
the Emperor frightens.”</p>

<p>There was a long wait, but after a while the
door opened, and the same young aide ushered him
into the Emperor’s cabinet; and just as Cartouche
had known, he felt as easy as ever in his life as
soon as he found himself alone with the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Emperor sat at a table, leaning his elbow
upon it. His pale and classic face was luminous
with a smile as he saw Cartouche; he had no more
forgotten the first man across the bridge at Lodi
than Cartouche had forgotten him.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” he said, smiling. “I was
about to send for you, because I have found out
some surprising things about your protegée, Mademoiselle
Fifi; and besides, I see by the newspapers
that she has drawn a prize of a hundred thousand
francs in the lottery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sire,” replied Cartouche, “and I want to
ask your Majesty what I am to do with Fifi’s hundred
thousand francs.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” cried the Emperor, getting up and
walking about the room with his hands behind his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>back, “I know no more what to do with a hundred
thousand francs than you do; I never had a hundred
thousand francs of my own in my life. I
have a civil list of forty millions, which I disburse
for the benefit of the state, but it is as much as I
can do to keep myself and my wife in clothes.
Women are expensive creatures, Cartouche.”</p>

<p>“True, your Majesty,” replied Cartouche, “and
Fifi does not know what to do with money when she
gets it&mdash;” Then, in a burst of confidence he told
the Emperor about the thirty francs Fifi had saved
up for a cloak and invested in a little black dog instead.
The Emperor threw back his head and
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“This Fifi must be a character. Well, I shall ask
Lebrun, the arch-treasurer, to give us his advice
about Fifi’s hundred thousand francs. But suppose
she will not trust you and me and the arch-treasurer
with her money?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about the arch-treasurer, your
Majesty, but I am sure Fifi will trust you, Sire,
and me. But what is to be done with Fifi herself,
is puzzling me.”</p>

<p>“That can be easily settled, I think. You remember
I told you, when I found her name was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>Chiaramonti, that I might have some surprising
news about her. I was, this very morning, contemplating
sending for you. Well, this young
lady, whom you found crying in the market-place
at Mantua, I have discovered is the granddaughter
of Barnabas Gregory Chiaramonti, who was the
first cousin and playmate, in his boyhood, of Gregory
Barnabas Chiaramonti, now reigning over the
Holy See as Pius the Seventh, and at present,
sojourning as my guest at the palace of Fontainebleau.”</p>

<p>Everything reeled before Cartouche, and he had
to hold on to the back of a chair to keep from
falling.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed. The world was changing
its aspect so rapidly to Cartouche that he hardly
recognized it as the same old planet he had known
for thirty-five years.</p>

<p>The Emperor waited until Cartouche had a little
recovered himself, although he was still pale and
breathed hard. Then the Emperor said:</p>

<p>“I shall cause the Holy Father to be informed
of Fifi’s existence. He is a good old man, although
as obstinate as the devil. Oh, I am sure we can arrange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
for Fifi; and then, Cartouche, how about a
husband for her?”</p>

<p>The Emperor, as he said this, looked steadily at
Cartouche; but Cartouche, looking back as steadily,
replied:</p>

<p>“I should think the Holy Father would arrange
that, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“True,” replied the Emperor, “but I wish one
of my deserving young officers might suit the Holy
Father as Fifi’s husband. I say, Cartouche, how
hard life is sometimes! Now, because Fifi is rich
through the lottery ticket you bought her, you
can never hope to marry her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your Majesty, that could not have been in
any event,” answered Cartouche, a dull red showing
through his dark skin. “I am sixteen years older
than Fifi, and I have a stiff leg, and although I
make what is reckoned a good living for a man like
me, it is not the sort of living for a notary’s daughter
like Fifi. No, your Majesty; I love Fifi, but I
never thought to make her my wife. She deserves
a better man than I am.”</p>

<p>“Another sort of a man, Cartouche, but not a
better one,” replied the Emperor, gently tweaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>Cartouche’s ear. “I shall arrange for the Holy
Father to be told of Fifi’s existence, and we shall
see about the hundred thousand francs; and, Cartouche,
if you are in any trouble or perplexity,
come to your Emperor.”</p>

<p>And with that, Cartouche knew the interview was
over, and he went away with a heart both light and
heavy. For Cartouche was a very human man after
all, and the thought of Fifi’s having a husband
made the whole world black to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">COURTSHIP AND CRIBBAGE</span></h2></div>

<p>Behold Fifi, a fortnight afterward, installed in
a quiet and correct apartment in the Rue de
l’Echelle, under the charge of a certain Madame
Bourcet, who was as quiet and correct as her apartment.
And Madame Bourcet had a nephew, Louis
Bourcet, more quiet and more correct even than
herself, and he aspired to marry Fifi and her hundred
thousand francs.</p>

<p>It was all like a dream to Fifi. The Emperor
had been as good as his word. He had consulted
Lebrun, the arch-treasurer, who had advised, as
Fifi was likely to be provided soon with a husband,
that the hundred thousand francs be again deposited
in the bank, as soon as it was drawn, less a
small amount for Fifi’s present expenses. He argued,
that it would simplify matters in her marriage
contract to have her <i>dot</i> in cash&mdash;which recommended
itself to all who knew, as sound doctrine.</p>

<p>He had also been asked by the Emperor, if he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>knew of a respectable person who would take charge
of Fifi for the present. It would still be some
time before the day came which she and Cartouche
had named for the actual payment of the money.
And besides it was necessary to prepare for Fifi’s
presentation to the Holy Father, and everybody,
including Fifi herself, agreed that certain preliminaries
of dress and custom be arranged for that
momentous interview. Lebrun had bethought him
of Madame Bourcet, whose deceased husband had
been a hanger-on of the arch-treasurer’s. Thus it
was that the day after Fifi finished her engagement
at the Imperial Theater, Cartouche had deposited
her and her boxes in the quiet apartment of
the quiet Madame Bourcet.</p>

<p>There was one box which she particularly treasured
and would not let out of her sight from the
time it was put into the van until it was placed in
the large, cold, handsome room which was set aside
for her in Madame Bourcet’s apartment. No one
but Fifi knew what was in this box. It contained
her whole theatrical wardrobe, consisting of three
costumes, and her entire assortment of wigs, old
shoes, cosmetics and such impedimenta. Fifi would
not have parted with these for half her fortune.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>They would be something real, substantial and familiar
in her new environment. They gave her a
mystic hold upon the street of the Black Cat, upon
the Imperial Theater, and upon Cartouche, so Fifi
felt.</p>

<p>Toto was brought along with the boxes, but
met with such a cool reception from Madame Bourcet
that he declined to remain; nor would Madame
Bourcet admit a dog of his theatrical antecedents
in her family. Nothing had been said about a
dog; she disliked dogs, because they barked; there
was no place for him in the apartment. Toto
showed his understanding of Madame Bourcet’s
attitude toward him by deliberately turning his
back on her, and walking out of the house after
Cartouche. Fifi said not a word. She was too
dazed to make any protest. Cartouche’s honest
heart was wrung when he left her sitting silent
and alone in Madame Bourcet’s drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was a large, dull room with a snuff-colored carpet
on the floor, snuff-colored furniture and snuff-colored
curtains to the windows, which overlooked
a great, quiet courtyard. No wonder that Fifi, as
soon as Cartouche left her, rushed into her own
room, which adjoined the drawing-room, and opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
her treasured box, took out an old white wig,
and clasping it to her bosom, rocked to and fro in
an agony. There was but one thing in the box
that was not hers, and that was a wooden javelin
which Cartouche had used with great effect in
his part of the centurion of the Pretorian Guard.
It was rather a commonplace looking javelin in
the cold light of day, but Fifi held that, too, to
her breast; it was those things that kept her from
losing her mind; they made her feel that after all,
the old life existed, and was not a nightmare, like
the present.</p>

<p>With the moral support of the wig and the
javelin she was enabled to compose herself, and
to meet Madame Bourcet and Louis Bourcet, the
nephew, and as Fifi shrewdly suspected, the person
assigned to become the future owner of her
hundred thousand francs. But Fifi had some ideas
of her own concerning her marriage, which, although
lying dormant for a time, were far from
moribund.</p>

<p>For this first evening in her snuff-colored house,
Fifi, with a heavy heart, put on her best gown; it
was very red and very skimpy, but Fifi had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>told she looked charming in it, which was the truth:
but it didn’t seem to charm Madame Bourcet, when
Fifi finally presented herself.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet was a small, obstinate, kindly,
narrow-minded woman, who went about measuring
the universe with her own tape line. Louis Bourcet
proved to be Madame Bourcet in trousers. Fifi
thought, if Louis were dressed up in his aunt’s petticoats
and Madame Bourcet were to put on Louis’
trousers, nobody could tell them apart.</p>

<p>Before this interesting youth was presented to
Fifi, Madame Bourcet informed her that Louis
was the most correct young advocate in Paris and
had not a fault. After this promising introduction,
Fifi hated Louis at first sight; but with that
overwhelming sense of strangeness and of being
led blindly toward an unknown fate, Fifi gave no
sign of dislike toward the most correct young advocate
in Paris, and the man without a fault.</p>

<p>As for Louis Bourcet, he thought that a discerning
Providence had dropped Fifi, with her hundred
thousand francs, into his mouth, as it were. He
knew that she had been an actress in a poor little
theater; but she was a Chiaramonti, her grandfather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
was own cousin to the Holy Father, and
the hundred thousand francs covered a multitude
of sins.</p>

<p>And it was another of the rewards of a judicious
Providence that Fifi’s money had come to
her as it had&mdash;dropping from the sky into her
lap. There was no prying father, no meddling
trustee to interfere with her prospective husband’s
future control of it. Louis Bourcet was honest, if
conceited, and meant to do a good part by Fifi.
He contemplated making her exactly like his aunt,
in every respect; and as Fifi was only nineteen,
Louis had not the slightest doubt that with his authority
as a husband, together with his personal
charms, he would be able to mold Fifi to his will, and
make her rapturously happy in the act of doing it.</p>

<p>As soon as Fifi was established in Madame Bourcet’s
apartment, Louis began to lay siege to her.
Regularly every evening at eight o’clock, he arrived&mdash;to
pay his respects to his aunt. Regularly
did he propose to play a game of cribbage with
Fifi: a dull and uninteresting game, which involved
counting&mdash;and counting had always been a
weak point with Fifi&mdash;she always counted her salary
at too much, and her expenses at too little.</p>

<p>Her counting at cribbage determined Louis to
keep the family purse himself, after they were married&mdash;for
Louis looked forward securely to this
event. Regularly at nine o’clock Madame Bourcet
fell asleep, or professed to fall asleep, peacefully in
her armchair. Regularly, Louis improved the
opportunity by telling Fifi how much his income
was, going into the minutest detail. That, however,
took only a short time; but much more was
consumed in telling how he spent it. A very little
wine; no cards or billiards; a solemn visit four
times the year to the Théâtre Française to see a
classic play, and a fortnight in summer in the
country. Such was the life which Louis subtly proposed
that Fifi should lead with him.</p>

<p>Fifi listened, dazed and silent. The room was
so quiet, so quiet, and at that hour all was life,
hustle, gaiety and movement at the Imperial Theater.
She knew to the very moment what Cartouche
was doing, and what Toto was doing;
and there was that hateful minx, Julie Campionet,
being rapturously applauded in parts which were
as much Fifi’s as the clothes upon Fifi’s back&mdash;for
Julie Campionet had promptly succeeded to Fifi’s
vacant place, in spite of Cartouche. All this distracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Fifi’s attention from the nightly game of
cribbage and made her count worse than ever.</p>

<p>And so Fifi began to live, for the first time,
without love and without work. Only the other
day, she remembered, she had been hungry and
hard-worked and happy: and now she was neither
hungry nor hard-worked, but assuredly, she was
not happy.</p>

<p>She had not seen Cartouche since the day he
left her and her boxes in the Rue de l’Echelle,
and had walked off with Toto, and, incidentally,
with all of Fifi’s happiness. She had directed him
to come to see her often, and he had not once been
near her! At this thought Fifi clenched her little
fists with rage: Cartouche was her own&mdash;her very
own&mdash;and how dared he treat her in this manner?</p>

<p>In the beginning, every day Fifi expected him,
and would run to the window twenty times in an
afternoon. But he neither came nor wrote. After
a while, Fifi’s heart became sore and she burst out
before Madame Bourcet and Louis:</p>

<p>“Cartouche has not come to see me; he has not
even written.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear child,” remonstrated Madame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>Bourcet, “you surely do not expect to keep up a
correspondence with a&mdash;a&mdash;person like this Monsieur&mdash;what&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;call&mdash;him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cartouche!” cried Fifi, opening her eyes very
wide indeed. “Why, Cartouche has done everything
for me! He taught me all I know about acting,
and he always carried my fagots upstairs,
and showed me how to clean my white shoes when
they became soiled, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Fifi stopped. She could have told a great deal
more: not only that Cartouche showed her how to
clean her white shoes, but that he actually took
the shoes off her poor little feet when she was so,
so tired; and Cartouche must have been tired, too,
having been on his legs&mdash;or rather his leg and a
half&mdash;all the day and evening. These, and other
reminiscences of Cartouche, in the capacity of
lady’s maid, cook, and what not, occurred to her
quick memory, almost overwhelming her. It
seemed to her as if he had done all for her that her
mother had once done, but she could not speak of
it before Madame Bourcet, still less Louis Bourcet.
Imagine the most correct young advocate in
Paris taking Fifi’s shoes off, because she was tired!
Louis would have let her die of fatigue before he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>would have committed this horrid crime, as he
conceived it.</p>

<p>So Fifi checked the ebullition that was rising in
her, and kept her head and held her tongue. But
when she was once alone in her own large, solemn
room, fitter for a dowager duchess than for little
Fifi, she poured out her soul in a letter to Cartouche&mdash;thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cartouche&mdash;Why haven’t you been to see me?
Cartouche, I believe you have forgotten me&mdash;that
odious Julie Campionet has played me some trick,
I know she has. Cartouche, having money is not
all we thought it was. It is very dull being rich
and certain of one’s dinner every day. Madame
Bourcet and I went out yesterday and bought a
gown. Cartouche, do you remember when I had
saved up the thirty francs to buy a cloak, and
bought Toto, my darling Toto, instead? And
how angry you were with me? And then you gave
me the cloak out of your own money? Don’t send
Toto to see me&mdash;it would break my heart. The
gown I bought yesterday is hideous. It is a dark
brown with green spots. Madame Bourcet selected
it. There was a beautiful pink thing, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>a great many spangles, that I wanted. It is just
like the stuff that Toto’s ballet skirt is made of.
But the gown is for me to wear the day I am presented
to the Holy Father, and Madame Bourcet
said the pink spangled thing would not do. Then
she bought me some black lace to wear over my
head that day, and she paid a cruel price for it,
but the shops where you get new things are very
dear. Madame Bourcet will not let me go to the
second-hand shops. Do you remember the blue
silk robe that Monsieur Duvernet made me buy a
year ago for forty francs, and how it turned out
to have a big grease-spot in the back, and I was
so afraid the spot would be seen, that it almost
ruined my performance as <i>Léontine</i> in ‘<i>Papa
Bouchard</i>’? And how do you get your costumes
to hang together when I am not there to sew them?
I know you are coming all to pieces by this time.
Have you forgotten how I used to sew you up?
Oh, Cartouche, have you forgotten all these things?
I think of them all the time. I wake up in the
night, thinking I hear Toto barking, and it is
only Madame Bourcet snoring. Cartouche, if you
don’t come to see me soon you will break my heart.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fifi.</span>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Cartouche read this letter sitting on the edge
of his poor bed. His eyes grew moist, and the
foolish fellow actually kissed Fifi’s name; but he
said to himself resolutely:</p>

<p>“No, I will not go to her. It will only make
the struggle harder. She must separate herself
from the old life, and the quicker, the better. The
pain is sharp, but it will not last&mdash;for her.”</p>

<p>And he was such a fool that he read the letter
aloud to Toto, who was huddled close to him: and
then the two who loved Fifi so dearly&mdash;the man
and the dog&mdash;rubbed noses, and mourned together,
Toto uttering a howl of distress and longing
that cut Cartouche to the heart.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, putting the dog aside, and rising,
“I can’t go on this way. One would think I
was sorry that Fifi is better off than she ever hoped
or dreamed.”</p>

<p>Then he went to his cupboard, and took out a
little frayed white satin slipper&mdash;one of Fifi’s slippers&mdash;and
held it tenderly in his hand, while his
poor heart was breaking. Next day, came a letter
of another sort from Fifi. She was very, very angry,
and wrote in a large hand, and with very
black ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cartouche: I will not stand your conduct. I
give you warning; I will not permit it. <i>You</i> are
responsible for my being here. But for you and
that&mdash;” here a word was erased, but Cartouche saw
the faint outlines of “devilish”&mdash;“lottery ticket, I
should have still been in my little room under the
roof&mdash;I should still have you and Toto. Oh, Cartouche,
I shall have to marry Louis Bourcet&mdash;I
see it, I know it, I feel it. He has not a fault in
the world, so Madame Bourcet says. Imagine
what a brute I shall appear alongside of him! He
plays cribbage. That is his only dissipation. But
I see that I must marry him, for this life I am
leading can not last. Madame Bourcet tells me
she has four or five diseases, any one of which is
liable to carry her off any day; and then I should
be left alone in Paris with a hundred thousand
francs. Something&mdash;everything seems to be driving
me toward marrying Louis Bourcet. Poor
Louis! How sorry he will be after he gets me!
Next week, Madame Bourcet takes me out to Fontainebleau
where I am to be presented to the Holy
Father. The gown has come home, and it is more
hideous than it was in the shop. If the Holy
Father has any taste in dress that gown will ruin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>my chances with him. Cartouche, I am not joking&mdash;I
can never joke any more. But I will not put
up with your behavior. Do you understand me?
It is Fifi who says this. You know, you always
told me when I flew into a rage I could frighten
Monsieur Duvernet. You remember, he often ran
into his closet and locked the door when I was
storming at him at the theater. I am much more
angry now.</p>

<p class="right">Fifi.”</p></div>

<p>To this letter also Cartouche made no answer.
He did not know the ways of ladies who had dowries
of a hundred thousand francs. He had heard
they were always supplied with husbands by some
one duly empowered; and these decisions, he imagined,
were like the laws of the Medes and Persians.
He felt for his poor little Fifi; her vivid, incoherent
words were perfectly intelligible to him and
went like a knife into his heart. He mused over
them in such poignant grief that he could hardly
drag himself through his multitude of duties. He
had no life or spirit to keep watch over Duvernet;
and Julie Campionet, one fine morning, took advantage
of this and, walking the manager off to
the <i>mairie</i>, married him out of hand. The first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>thing Cartouche knew of it was when the bridegroom,
with a huge white favor in his buttonhole,
marched into Cartouche’s garret.</p>

<p>“She’s done it, Cartouche,” groaned Duvernet.
“They all do.”</p>

<p>Cartouche knew perfectly well what poor Duvernet
meant.</p>

<p>“She has, has she?” he roared, “and did you tell
her about the three other women you have married,
and got yourself in such a precious mess with?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” groaned Duvernet, seating himself on the
side of the bed. “She knows all about it&mdash;but I
couldn’t explain which ones had sued me for divorce,
and which I had sued. But Julie didn’t
mind. You see, she is thirty-six years old, and
never has been married, and she made up her mind
it wasn’t worth while to wait longer; and when
women get that way, it’s no use opposing them.”</p>

<p>“The last time,” shouted Cartouche, quite beside
himself at the manager’s folly, for which he himself
felt twinges of conscience, “the last time you said it
was because she was a widow! Duvernet, as sure
as you are alive, you will bring yourself behind the
bars of Ste. Pélagie.”</p>

<p>“If I do,” cried poor Duvernet, stung by Cartouche’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
reproaches, “whose fault will it be? If
you had kept an eye on Julie Campionet, this never
would have happened. It was you who bought
that cursed lottery ticket for Fifi, and lost me the
only leading lady I ever had who didn’t insist on
marrying me against my will.”</p>

<p>Here was a cud for Cartouche to chew upon:
young ladies reproaching him bitterly for giving
them a hundred thousand francs in cash, and
happy bridegrooms reviling him because through
him they secured brides. Cartouche was too
stunned by it all to answer. The only thing he
could do was to try to keep Duvernet’s unfortunate
weakness from landing him in jail. Luckily,
none of his wives had any use for Duvernet, after a
very short probation, and as he had no property to
speak of, and the earnings of the Imperial Theater
were uncertain, there was no money to be squeezed
out of him. So, unless the authorities should get
wind of Duvernet’s matrimonial ventures, which he
persisted in regarding as mere escapades, into
which he was led by a stronger will than his own,
he would be allowed to roam at large.</p>

<p>“At all events,” said Cartouche, after a while,
“I can make Julie Campionet behave herself as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>long as she is willing to stay here by threatening to
lodge an information against both of you with the
magistrate.”</p>

<p>“Do,” anxiously urged Duvernet. “I would not
mind serving a short term in prison if Julie gets
troublesome. Well, all men are fools where women
are concerned.”</p>

<p>“No, they are not,” replied Cartouche darkly;
“there are a few bachelors left.”</p>

<p>“It is fate, destiny, what you will,” said the
mournful bridegroom. “That woman, Julie Campionet&mdash;or
Duvernet she is now&mdash;meant to marry
me from the start, just like the rest. Oh, if only
little Fifi were here once more!”</p>

<p>If only little Fifi were here once more! Poor
Cartouche’s lonely heart echoed that wish.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">A PARCEL OF OLD SHOES</span></h2></div>

<p>The day arrived when Fifi’s hundred thousand
francs was to be paid over to her and deposited in
the bank. Fifi had taken for granted that Cartouche
would be with her on that momentous occasion;
but when the day came no Cartouche appeared,
so she was forced to ask Madame Bourcet
and Louis Bourcet to attend her. This they both
agreed to do, with the utmost alacrity.</p>

<p>Fifi still remained perfectly and strangely docile,
but her mind had begun to work normally once
more, and Fifi had a very strong little mind, which
could work with great vigor. She had the enormous
advantage of belonging to that class of persons
who always know exactly what they want, and
what they do not want. She did not want to have
her money where she could not get it; and banks
seemed to her mysterious institutions which were
designed to lock people’s money up and prevent
them from getting the benefit of it, but offered no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>security whatever that somebody other than the
owner should not get the benefit of it. She had
heretofore kept all her money&mdash;when she had any&mdash;sewed
up in her mattress, in a place where she
could feel it, if she wished to; and the mattress was
perfectly safe; whereas, she had no guaranty that
the bank was.</p>

<p>So Fifi quietly but decisively made up her mind
that she would get hold of her hundred thousand
francs and put it in a safe place&mdash;that is to say,
the mattress. It might not be difficult to manage.
Madame Bourcet told her she must take a tin box
with her, and kindly provided the box; but it
was not impossible&mdash;Suppose, thought Fifi, she
could quietly transfer the money to a large reticule
she possessed, and put something, old shoes, for
example, in the tin box she would deposit in the
bank? She had plenty of old shoes in her mysterious
trunk. Fifi was charmed with this notion.</p>

<p>On the morning of the great day she took the
precaution to fill her reticule with old shoes, fasten
it to her belt, and it was so well concealed by her
flowing red cloak that nobody but herself knew
she had a reticule. Madame Bourcet, Louis and
herself were to go in the carriage of Madame Bourcet’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
brother, a professor of mathematics, who had
married a fortune of two hundred thousand francs,
and was held up as a model of wisdom and a
prodigy of virtue therefor.</p>

<p>The carriage arrived, and the party set out.
Louis Bourcet regarded Fifi with an eye of extreme
favor. She had never asserted herself, or contradicted
any one, or said a dozen words consecutively,
since she had been with Madame Bourcet; and she
had a hundred thousand francs of her own.</p>

<p>Louis thought he could not have found a wife
better suited to him if she had been made to order.
As she was the granddaughter to the Pope’s
cousin, her experiences in the street of the Black
Cat were evenly balanced by her other advantages.</p>

<p>As they jolted soberly along, Fifi’s mind was
busy with her provident scheme of guarding
against banks. When they reached the bank&mdash;a
large and imposing establishment&mdash;they were
ushered into a private room, where sat several official-looking
persons. A number of transfers
were made in writing, the money was produced,
counted, and placed in Fifi’s tin box.</p>

<p>This ended that part of the formalities. Then
the box was to be sealed up and placed in a strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>box hired from the bank. Fifi herself carried the
tin box under her cloak, and, accompanied by
Madame Bourcet and Louis, went to another apartment
in the bank, from which they were taken to
the strong room in the basement. There Fifi solemnly
handed over her tin box to be tied and sealed,
and accepted a receipt for it; and it was put away
securely in a little dungeon of its own.</p>

<p>Never was a parcel of old shoes treated with
greater respect, for in it reposed the contents of
Fifi’s reticule, while in the reticule peacefully lay a
hundred thousand francs. It had been done under
the noses of Madame Bourcet and Louis&mdash;and with
the utmost neatness&mdash;for Fifi was accustomed to
acting, and was in no way discomposed by having
people about her, but was rather steadied and emboldened.</p>

<p>On the return home in the carriage Louis Bourcet
treated her with such distinguished consideration
that he was really afraid his attentions, including
the numerous games of cribbage, were
compromising, but Fifi noted him not. Her mind
was fixed on the contents of her reticule, and the
superior satisfaction it is to have one’s money safe
in a mattress where one can get at it, instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>being locked up in a bank where everybody could
get at it except one’s self.</p>

<p>That night, while Madame Bourcet snored and
snoozed peacefully, Fifi, by the light of a solitary
candle, was down on her knees, sewing her money
up in the mattress. She made a hard little knob
of it right in the middle, so she could feel it every
time she turned over in bed. Then, climbing into
bed, she slept the sleep of conscious innocence and
peace.</p>

<p>The next event in Fifi’s life was to be her presentation
to the Holy Father. For this Madame
Bourcet severely coached Fifi. She was taught
how to walk, how to speak, how to curtsey, how to
go in and how to go out of the room on the great
occasion. Fifi learned with her new docility and
obedience, but had a secret conviction that she
would forget it all as soon as the occasion came to
use it.</p>

<p>A week or two after Fifi had rescued her money
from the bank the day arrived for her presentation
to the Holy Father, who had personally appointed
the time. Since Fifi’s journey from Italy in her
childhood, she had never been so far from the street
of the Black Cat as Fontainebleau, and the length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>and expense of the journey impressed her extremely.
Louis Bourcet did not accompany Madame
Bourcet and Fifi on the visit, but it was understood
that Madame Bourcet should present his application
for Fifi’s hand.</p>

<p>It was a soft, mild day in February, with a hint
of spring in the air, that they set forth in a rickety
coach for Fontainebleau. Fifi wore the hideous
brown gown with the green spots in it, and felt
exactly as she did the night she played <i>Léontine</i> in
the blue silk robe with the grease spot in the back.
If the grease spot had been noticed everything
would have been ruined&mdash;and if the Holy Father
should notice the brown gown! Fifi felt that it
would mean wholesale disaster. She comforted herself,
however, with the reflection that the Holy
Father probably knew nothing about ladies’
gowns; and then, she had never forgotten the extreme
kindness of the Holy Father’s eyes the night
she peered at him in the coach.</p>

<p>“And after all,” she thought, “although Cartouche
laughed at me for thinking the Holy Father
had looked at me that night, I know he did&mdash;perhaps
I am like my father or my grandfather, and
that was why he looked.” And then she remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
what Cartouche had said about the private
soldiers not being afraid when the Emperor talked
with them. “It will be the same with the Holy
Father,” she thought. “He is so far above me&mdash;why,
it would be ridiculous for me to be afraid of
him.”</p>

<p>It took all of three hours to get to Fontainebleau,
and Fifi felt that the world was a very large
place indeed. They drove through the splendid
park and dismounted before the great château.
Then, Madame Bourcet showing some cabalistic
card or other token, it was understood that the visit
of the two ladies was expected by the Pope. They
were escorted up the great horseshoe stairs and into
a small salon, where luncheon was served to them,
after their long drive. Madame Bourcet was too
elegant to eat much, but Fifi, whose appetite had
been in abeyance ever since she left the street of
the Black Cat, revived, and she devoured her share
with a relish. It was the first time she had been
hungry since she had had enough to eat.</p>

<p>Presently a sour-looking ecclesiastic came to escort
them to the presence of the Holy Father. The
ecclesiastic was clearly in a bad humor. The Holy
Father was always being appealed to by widows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>with grievances, real or imaginary, young ladies
who did not want to marry the husbands selected
for them, young men who had got themselves in
discredit with their families or superiors, and the
Holy Father had a way of treating these sinners
as if they were not sinners at all. Indeed, he often
professed himself to be edified by their pious repentance;
and the ecclesiastic never quite understood
whether the Holy Father was quietly amusing
himself at the expense of his household or not.
But one thing was certain to the ecclesiastic’s mind:
the Holy Father had not that horror of sinners
which the world commonly has, and was far too
easy on them.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in mind, he introduced
Madame Bourcet into the Pope’s cabinet, while
Fifi remained in the anteroom, guarded by another
ecclesiastic, who looked much more human than his
colleague. This last one thought it necessary to
infuse courage into Fifi concerning the coming interview,
but to his amazement found Fifi not in the
least afraid.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why, Monsieur, I should be
afraid,” she said. “A friend of mine&mdash;Cartouche&mdash;says
the private soldiers are not the least afraid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>of the Emperor, and are perfectly at ease when he
speaks to them, while the councillors of state and
the marshals and the great nobles can not look him
in the eye.”</p>

<p>“And may I ask who is this Cartouche, Mademoiselle?”
asked the ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>“He is a friend of mine,” replied Fifi warily.</p>

<p>At last, after twenty minutes, Madame Bourcet
came out. She was pale and agitated, but showed
satisfaction in every feature.</p>

<p>“The Holy Father approves of my nephew, provided
you have no objection to him,” she whispered.
And the next moment Fifi found herself alone with
the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Although the afternoon was mild and sunny, a
large fire was burning on the hearth, and close to
it, in a large armchair, sat Pius the Seventh. He
gave Fifi the same impression of whiteness and benevolence
he had given her at that chance meeting
three months before.</p>

<p>As Fifi entered she made a low bow&mdash;not the one
that Madame Bourcet had taught her, but a much
better one, taught her by her own tender little
heart. And instantly, as before, there was an
electric sympathy established between the old man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>and the young girl, as the old and young eyes exchanged
confidences.</p>

<p>“My child,” were the Holy Father’s first words,
in a voice singularly young and sweet for an old
man. “I have seen you before, and now I know
why it was that the sight of your eyes so moved
me. You are my Barnabas’ granddaughter.”</p>

<p>And then Fifi made one of the most outlandish
speeches imaginable for a young girl to make to
the Supreme Pontiff. She said:</p>

<p>“Holy Father, as I looked into your eyes that
night when your coach was passing through the
street of the Black Cat, I said to myself, ‘There is
an old man with a father’s heart,’ and I felt as if
I had seen my own father.”</p>

<p>And instead of meeting this speech with a look
of cold reproof, the Holy Father’s eyes grew moist,
and he said:</p>

<p>“It was the cry of kindred between us. Now,
sit near to me&mdash;not in that armchair.”</p>

<p>“Here is a footstool,” cried Fifi, and drawing
the footstool up to the Holy Father’s knees, she
seated herself with no more fear than Cartouche
had of his Emperor.</p>

<p>“Now, my child,” said the Holy Father, “the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>old must always be allowed to tell their stories first,&mdash;the
young have time to wait. I know that you
can not have seen your grandfather, or even remember
your own father, he died so young.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father, I was so little when he died.”</p>

<p>“I could have loved him as a son, if I had known
him,” the Holy Father continued, speaking softly
as the old do of a bygone time. “But never was
any one so much a part of my heart as Barnabas
was. We were born within a month of each other,
at Cesena, a little old town at the foot of the Apennines.
I think I never saw so pretty and pleasant
an old town as Cesena&mdash;so many fine young men
and excellent maidens, such venerable old people.
One does not see such nowadays.”</p>

<p class="p2b">Fifi said nothing, but she did not love the Holy
Father less for this simplicity of the old which is so
like the simplicity of the young.</p>

<p class="p2">“Barnabas and I grew up together in an old
villa, all roses and honeysuckles outside, all rats
and mice within&mdash;but we did not mind the rats and
mice. When we grew out of our babyhood into
two naughty, troublesome boys, we thought it fine
sport to hunt the poor rats and torture them. I
was worse in that respect than Barnabas, who was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>ever a better boy than I. But we had other amusements
than that. We loved to climb into the blue
hills about Cesena, and when we were old enough
to be trusted by ourselves we would sometimes spend
days in those far-off hills, with nothing but bread
and cheese and wild grapes to live on. We slept
at night on the ground, rolled in our blankets. We
were hardy youngsters, and I never had sweeter
sleep than in those summer nights on the hard
ground, with the kind stars keeping watch over
us.”</p>

<p>Fifi said no word. The old man was living over
again that sweet, young time, and from it was
borne the laughter, faint and afar off, the smiles
so softly tender, the tears robbed of all their saltness;
he was once more, in thought, a little boy
with his little playmate on the sunny slopes of the
Apennines.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke again, looking into Fifi’s
eyes, so like those of the dead and gone comrade of
the old Cesena days.</p>

<p>“Barnabas, although of better natural capacity
than I, did not love the labor of reading. He
chose that I should read, and tell him what I read;
and so he knew all that I knew and more besides,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>being of sharper and more observant mind. We
never had a difference except once. It was over a
cherry tart&mdash;what little gluttons we were! When
we quarreled about the tart our mothers divided it,
and for punishment condemned us both to eat our
share alone. And what do you think was the result?
Neither one of us would touch it&mdash;and then
we cried and made up our quarrel; it was our first
and last, and we were but ten years old.”</p>

<p>Fifi listened with glowing eyes. These little
stories of his youth, long remembered, made Fifi
feel as if the Holy Father were very human, after
all.</p>

<p>The old man paused, and his expressive eyes
grew dreamy as he gazed at Fifi. She brought
back to him, as never before, the dead and gone
time: the still, ancient little town, lying as quietly
in the sunlight as in the moonlight, the peaceful
life that flowed there so placidly and innocently.
He seemed to hear again the murmuring of the
wind in the fir trees of the old garden and the delicate
cooing of the blue and white pigeons in the
orchard. Once more he inhaled the aromatic scent
of the burning pine cones, as Barnabas and himself,
their two boyish heads together, hung over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>the scanty fire in the great vaulted kitchen of the
old villa. All, all, were gone; the villa had fallen
to decay; the orchard and the garden were no
more; only the solemn fir trees and the dark blue
peaks of the Apennines remained unchanged. And
here was a girl with the same eyes, dark, yet softly
bright, of his playfellow and more than brother of
fifty years ago!</p>

<p>Fifi spoke no word. The only sound in the
small, vaulted room was the faint crackling of the
burning logs, across which a brilliant bar of sunlight
had crept stealthily. As the Holy Father
paused and looked at Fifi, there was a gentle deprecation
in his glance; he seemed to be saying:
“Bear with age a while, O glorious and pathetic
youth! Let me once more dream your dreams,
and lay aside the burden of greatness.” And the
old man did not continue until he saw in Fifi’s eyes
that she was not wearied with him; then he spoke
again.</p>

<p>“When we were ten years old we were taught to
serve on the altar. Barnabas served with such
recollection, such beautiful precision, that it was
like prayer to see him. He was a handsome boy,
and in his white surplice and red cassock, his face
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>glowing with the noble innocence and simplicity of
a good boyhood, he looked like a young archangel.”</p>

<p>“And yourself, Holy Father?” asked Fifi.</p>

<p>“Ah, I was very unlike Barnabas. I was but
an ordinary-looking boy, and I often fell asleep
while I was sitting by the priest during the sermon,
and in full view of the congregation. We had a
worthy old priest, who would let me sleep during
the sermon, but would pinch me smartly to wake
me up when it was over and it was time again to
go on the altar. So I devised a way to keep myself
awake. I hid a picture book in the sleeve of
my cassock, and during the sermon, while the priest
who was on the altar had his eyes fixed on the one
who was preaching in the pulpit, I slipped out
my picture book, and began to look at it stealthily,&mdash;but
not so stealthily that the priest did not see
me, and, quietly reaching over, took it out of my
hand and put it in the pocket of his cassock. I
plotted revenge, however. Presently, when the
priest went up on the altar and is forbidden to
leave it, he turned and motioned to me for the
water, which it was my duty to have ready. I
whispered to him, ‘Give me my picture book, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>I will give you the water.’ Of course, he had to
give me the picture book, and then I gave him the
water. He did not tell my parents on me, wherein
he failed in his duty; but he gave me, after mass,
a couple of sound slaps&mdash;and I played no more
tricks on him.”</p>

<p>“Holy Father, you must have been a flesh-and-blood
boy,” said Fifi, softly.</p>

<p>The Holy Father laughed&mdash;a fresh, youthful
laugh, like his voice.</p>

<p>“Formerly I judged myself harshly. Now I
know that, though I was not a very good boy, I
was not a bad boy. I was not so good a boy as
Barnabas. He had no vocation for the priesthood;
but in my eighteenth year the wish to be a priest
awoke in me. And the hardest of all the separations
which my vocation entailed was the parting
with Barnabas. He went to Piacenza and became
an advocate. He married and died within a year,
leaving a young widow and one child&mdash;your father.
They were well provided for, and the mother’s family
took charge of the widow and of the child. But
the widow, too, soon died, and only your father
was left. I often wished to see him, and my heart
yearned like a father’s over him, but I was a poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>parish priest, far away from him, and could hear
nothing from him. Then in the disorders that
followed the French Revolution one lost sight of
all that one had ever known and loved. I caused
diligent inquiry to be made&mdash;I was a bishop then,
and could have helped Barnabas’ son&mdash;but I could
not find a trace of him. He, like Barnabas, had
married and died young, leaving an only child&mdash;yourself&mdash;and,
I knew it not! The great whirlpool
of the Revolution seemed to swallow up everything.
But on the night of my arrival in Paris,
as we passed slowly along that narrow street, and
I saw your face peering into my carriage, it was
as if my Barnabas had come back to me. You
are more like him than I believed any child could
be like its father. So, when I heard, through the
agency of the Emperor, that a young relative of
mine, by name Chiaramonti, was in Paris, earning
her living, I felt sure it was the young girl who
looked into my carriage that night.”</p>

<p>“But I am not earning my living now, Holy
Father.”</p>

<p>“So I hear. You have had strange good fortune&mdash;good
fortune in having done honest work in
your poverty, and good fortune in being under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>the charge of the excellent and respectable Madame
Bourcet, since there was no need for you to work.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” Here Fifi paused and struggled for
a moment with herself, then burst out: “I was
happier, far, when I was earning my living. The
theater was small, and ill lighted, and my wages
were barely enough to live upon, and I often was
without a fire; but at least I had Cartouche and
Toto.”</p>

<p>“And who are Cartouche and Toto?” asked the
Holy Father, mildly.</p>

<p>Then Fifi told the story of Cartouche; how
brave he was at the bridge of Lodi; how he had
befriended her, and stood between her and harm;
and, strange to say, the Pope appeared not the
least shocked at things that would have paralyzed
Madame Bourcet and Louis Bourcet. Fifi told
him all about the thirty francs she had saved up
for the cloak, and the spending it in buying Toto,
and the Holy Father laughed outright. He
asked many questions about the theater, and the
life of the people there, and agreed with Fifi when
she said sagely:</p>

<p>“Cartouche says there is not much more of virtue
in one calling than another, and that those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>people, like poor actors and actresses, who live
from hand to mouth, and can’t be very particular,
are in the way of doing more kindnesses for each
other than people who lead more regular lives.
Cartouche, you know, Holy Father, is a plain,
blunt man.”</p>

<p>“Like Mark Antony,” replied the Pope, smiling.
Fifi had never heard of such a person as Mark
Antony, so very wisely held her peace.</p>

<p>“But this Cartouche seems to be an honest fellow,”
added the Pope.</p>

<p>“Holy Father,” cried Fifi, earnestly, “Cartouche
is as honest as you are!”</p>

<p>“I should like to see him,” said the Holy Father,
smiling at Fifi.</p>

<p>“If I could, I would make him come to you&mdash;but
he will not even come to see me,” said Fifi sadly.
“Before he took me to Madame Bourcet’s he told
me I must leave my old life behind me. He said,
‘It will be hard, Fifi, but it must be done resolutely.’
I said: ‘At least if I see no one else of those people,
whom I really love, now that I am separated
from them&mdash;except Julie Campionet’&mdash;I shall always
hate Julie Campionet&mdash;‘I shall see you.’
‘No,’ said Cartouche, in an obstinate voice that I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>knew well,&mdash;Cartouche is as obstinate as a donkey
when he wishes to be,&mdash;‘if you see me you will have
a new struggle every time we part. Years from
now, when you are fixed in another life, when you
are suitably married, it will do you no harm to see
me, but not now,’&mdash;and actually, Holy Father,
that mean, cruel, heartless Cartouche has kept his
word, and has not been near me, or even answered
my letters.”</p>

<p>“Cartouche is a sensible fellow,” said the Holy
Father, under his breath.</p>

<p>Luckily Fifi did not catch the words, or she
would, in her own mind, have stigmatized the Holy
Father as also mean, cruel and heartless, just like
Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Pope aloud, “tell me about
Julie Campionet. Why do you hate her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Holy Father, Julie Campionet is a minx.
She married the manager against his will, and has
stolen all my best parts, and has made everybody
at the theater forget there ever was a Mademoiselle
Fifi. You can’t imagine a person more evil than
Julie Campionet.”</p>

<p>“Wicked, wicked Julie Campionet,” said the
Holy Father softly; and Fifi knew he was laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
at her. Then he grew serious and said: “My
child, it is important&mdash;nay, necessary&mdash;for you to
be properly married. You are too young, too
friendless, too inexperienced, to be safe until you
have the protection of a good husband. Madame
Bourcet has brought me proofs of the worth and
respectability of her nephew, Monsieur Louis
Bourcet, and, as the head of your family, I urge
you to marry this worthy young man.”</p>

<p>Fifi sat still, the dazed, submissive look coming
back into her face. Everything seemed to compel
her to marry Louis Bourcet. As the Holy Father
had said, she must marry some one. She felt a
sense of despair, which involved resignation to her
fate. The Holy Father looked at her sharply,
but said gently:</p>

<p>“Is there no one else?”</p>

<p>“No one, Holy Father,” replied Fifi.</p>

<p>There was no one but Cartouche; and Cartouche
would neither see her nor write to her, and besides
had never spoken a word of love to her in his life.
If she had remained at the theater she could have
made Cartouche marry her; but now that was impossible.
Fifi was finding out some things in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>new life which robbed her of one of her chief
weapons&mdash;ignorance of convention.</p>

<p>“And Monsieur Bourcet is worthy?” she heard
the Holy Father saying, and she replied mechanically:</p>

<p>“Quite worthy.”</p>

<p>“And you do not dislike him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Fifi, after a moment’s pause. There
was not enough in Louis Bourcet to dislike.</p>

<p>Fifi rose. She could not bear any more on this
subject. The Holy Father, smiling at Fifi’s taking
the initiative in closing the interview, said to
her:</p>

<p>“Then you agree to marry Louis Bourcet?”</p>

<p>“I agree to marry Louis Bourcet,” replied Fifi,
in a voice that sounded strange in her own ears.
She did not know what else to say. Two months
ago she would have replied briskly, “No, indeed; I
shall marry Cartouche, and nobody but Cartouche.”
Now, however, she seemed to be under
a spell. It appeared to be arranged for her that
she should marry Louis Bourcet, and Cartouche
would not lift a finger to help her. And, strangest
of all, in saying she would marry Louis Bourcet she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>did not really know whether she meant it or not.
It was all an uneasy dream.</p>

<p>The Pope raised his hand to bless her. Fifi, looking
at him, saw that the stress of emotion at seeing
her was great. The pallor of his face had given
place to a dull flush, and his uplifted hand trembled.</p>

<p>“You will come again, my child, when your future
is settled?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father,” replied Fifi, and sank on
her knees to receive his blessing.</p>

<p>As she walked toward the door, the Holy Father
called to her:</p>

<p>“Remember that Julie Campionet, in spite of her
crimes toward you, is one of God’s children.”</p>

<p>Fifi literally ran out of the room. It seemed to
her as if the Holy Father were taking Julie Campionet’s
part.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BLUE SATIN BED</span></h2></div>

<p>Two weeks after the visit to Fontainebleau came
the crisis&mdash;for Fifi was as surely tending toward a
crisis as water flows downward and sparks fly upward.
Madame Bourcet, armed with the Holy
Father’s approval, represented to Fifi the necessity
for her marrying Louis Bourcet. Fifi listened silently.
Then, Madame Bourcet, eagerly taking
silence for consent, said that Louis would that very
evening accept formally of Fifi’s hand. To this
also Fifi made no reply, and Madame Bourcet
left the room fully persuaded that Fifi was reveling
in rapture at the thought of acquiring an
epitome of all the virtues in Louis Bourcet.</p>

<p>It was during the morning, and in the snuff-colored
drawing-room, that the communication was
made. Fifi felt a great wave of doubt and anxiety
swelling up in her heart. For the first time
she was brought face to face with the marriage
problem, and it frightened her by its immensity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>If only Cartouche were there&mdash;some one to whom
she could pour out her trembling, agitated heart!
But Cartouche was not there, nor would he come.
And suddenly, for the first time, something of the
fierceness of maidenhood overwhelmed Fifi&mdash;a feeling
that Cartouche should, after all, seek her&mdash;that,
if he loved her, as she knew he did above
everything on earth, he should speak and not shame
her by his silence.</p>

<p>Then, the conviction that Cartouche preferred
her good to his, that he thought she would be
happier married to another and a different man,
and held himself honestly unworthy to marry her,
brought a flood of tenderness to her heart. She
had seen Cartouche turn red and pale when she
kissed him, and avoid her innocent familiarities,
and she knew well enough what it meant. But if
he would not come, nor speak, nor write,&mdash;and
everybody, even the Holy Father, was urging her
to marry Louis Bourcet; and a great, strong chain
of circumstances was dragging her toward the
same end&mdash;oh, what a day of emotions it was to
Fifi!</p>

<p>She knew not how it passed, nor what she said
or did, nor what she ate and drank; she only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>waited, as if for the footfall of fate, for the hour
when Louis Bourcet would arrive. He came at
eight, punctual to the minute. Punctuality, like
every other virtue, was his. Madame Bourcet
whispered something to him, and Louis, for the
first time, touched Fifi’s hand and brushed it with
his lips, Fifi standing like a statue. The crisis was
rapidly becoming acute.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, the cribbage board was brought
out; Madame Bourcet dutifully fell asleep, and
Louis, with the air of doing the most important
thing in the world, took from his pocket a small
picture of himself, which he presented to Fifi with
a formal speech, of which she afterward could not
recall one word. Nor could she remember what he
talked about during the succeeding half-hour before
Madame Bourcet waked up. Then Louis
rose to go, and something was said about happiness
and economy in the management of affairs;
and Louis announced that owing to the necessity
of procuring certain papers from Strasburg, where
his little property lay, the marriage contract could
not be signed for a month yet, and inquired if Fifi
would be ready to marry him at the end of the
month. Fifi instantly replied yes, and then the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>crisis was over. From that moment nothing on
earth would have induced Fifi to marry Louis Bourcet.</p>

<p>She did not, of course, put this in words, but
sent poor Louis off with her promise to marry him
in a month. Nevertheless, by one of those processes
of logic which Fifi could not formulate to
save her life, but which she could act up to in the
teeth of fire and sword, the promise to marry Louis
Bourcet settled for all time that she would not
marry him.</p>

<p>Up to that moment all had been vague, agitating,
mysterious and compelling. She felt herself
driven, if not to marry Louis Bourcet, to act as
if she meant to marry him. But once she had
promised, once she had something tangible to go
upon, her spirit burst its chains, and she was once
more free. She had no more notion of marrying
Louis Bourcet then than she had of trying to
walk on her head. And she felt such a wild, tempestuous
joy&mdash;the first flush of happiness she had
known since the wretched lottery ticket had drawn
the prize. She was so happy that she was glad
to escape to her own room. She carried in her
hand the picture of Louis Bourcet, and did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>know she held it until she put it down on her mantelpiece
and saw in the mirror above it her own
smiling, glowing face.</p>

<p>“No, Louis,” she said to the picture, shaking her
head solemnly, “it is not to be. I have been a fool
heretofore in not saying outright that I wouldn’t
marry you to save your life. But now my mind is
made up. Nobody can make me marry you, and
I would not do it if Cartouche, the Holy Father
and the Emperor all commanded me to marry you!”</p>

<p>Then an impish thought came into Fifi’s head,
for Fifi was in some respects a cruel young person.
She would make Louis himself refuse to marry her
and contrive so that all the blame would be visited
upon the innocent Louis, while she, the wicked Fifi,
would go free. In a flash it was revealed to her;
it was to get rid of her hundred thousand francs.
Then Louis would not marry her&mdash;and oh, rapture!
Cartouche would.</p>

<p>“He can’t refuse,” thought Fifi in an ecstasy.
“When I have been jilted and cruelly used, and
have no money, then I can go back to the stage,
and everybody will know me as Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti, granddaughter of the Pope’s cousin,
who won the great prize in the lottery; everybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>will flock to see me, as they did the last two weeks
I played; and I shall have forty francs the week,
and Cartouche, and love and work and peace and
Toto, and no Louis Bourcet! And how angry Julie
Campionet will be!”</p>

<p>It was so deliciously easy to get at her money&mdash;a
rip and a stitch afterward&mdash;ten thousand francs
squandered before Louis Bourcet’s eyes. Fifi
thought the loss of the first ten thousand would rid
her of her fiancé, but she knew she could never get
Cartouche as long as she had even ten thousand
francs left, and she realized fully that it was Cartouche
that she wanted most of anything in the
world. The Holy Father would probably scold
her a little, but Fifi felt sure, if she could only tell
the Holy Father just how she felt and how good
Cartouche was, and also how odiously good Louis
Bourcet was, he would forgive her.</p>

<p>The more Fifi thought of this scheme of getting
rid of Louis Bourcet and entrapping Cartouche the
more rapturous she grew. She had two ways of
expressing joy and thankfulness&mdash;praying and
dancing. She plumped down on her knees, and
for about twenty seconds thanked God earnestly
for having shown her the way to get rid of Louis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>Bourcet&mdash;for Fifi’s prayers, like herself, were very
primitive and childlike. Then, jumping up, she
danced for twenty minutes, kicking as high as she
could, until she finally kicked the picture of Louis
Bourcet off the mantelpiece to the floor, on which
it fell with a sharp crash.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet, in the next room, stirred at
once. Fifi again plumped down on her knees, and
when Madame Bourcet opened the door Fifi was
deeply engaged in saying her prayers. Madame
Bourcet shut the door softly&mdash;the noise could not
have been in Fifi’s room.</p>

<p>As soon as Madame Bourcet was again snoozing,
Fifi, moving softly about, lighted her candle and
wrote a letter to Cartouche.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cartouche, my mind is made up. This evening
I promised Louis Bourcet, in Madame Bourcet’s
presence, to marry him. When I had done it
I felt as if a load were lifted off my mind, for as
soon as the words were out of my mouth I determined
that nothing on earth should induce me to
keep my promise. I feel that I am right, Cartouche,
and I have not felt so pious for a long
time. I don’t know how it will be managed. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>am only certain of one thing, and that is that Louis
Bourcet will never become Monsieur Fifi Chiaramonti&mdash;for
that is just what it would amount to,
he is so good and so colorless. I am not in the
least sorry for Louis. I am only sorry for myself
that I have been bothered with him so long, and
besides, I wish to marry some one else.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fifi.”</p>
</div>

<p>Fifi crept into bed after writing this letter. For
the first time she found the hard lump in the middle
of her mattress uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” thought Fifi to herself, “I shall
soon be rid of it, and sleep in peace, as I haven’t
done since I had it.”</p>

<p>Fifi’s dreams were happy that night, and when
she waked in the morning she felt a kind of
dewy freshness in her heart, like the awakening of
spring. It was springtime already, and as Fifi
lay cosily in her little white bed she contrived joyous
schemes for her own benefit, which some people
might have called plotting mischief. She reasoned
with herself thus:</p>

<p>“Fifi, you have been miserable ever since you got
the odious, hateful hundred thousand francs, and
it was nasty of Cartouche to give you the lottery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>ticket. Fifi, you are not very old, but you are
of the sort which does not change, and you will be
Fifi as long as you live. You can not be happy
away from Cartouche and the theater and Toto&mdash;unfeeling
wretch that you are, to let Toto be torn
from you! So the only thing to do is to return to
love and work. If you spend all your money
Louis Bourcet would not marry you to save your
life, and then you can go back to the theater and
make Cartouche marry you. Oh, how simple it is!
Stupid, stupid Fifi, that you did not think of this
before!” And, throbbing with happiness at the
emancipation before her, Fifi rose and dressed herself.
She was distracted by the riotous singing
of the robins in the one solitary tree in the courtyard.
Heretofore the little birds had been mute
and half frozen, but this morning, in the warm
spring sun, they sang in ecstasy.</p>

<p>Fifi not only felt different, but she actually
looked so; and the blitheness which shone in her
eyes when she went to ask Madame Bourcet if she
might have Angéline, the sour maid-of-all-work,
to go with her to the shops that morning might
have awakened suspicion in most minds. But not
in Madame Bourcet’s. Fifi slyly let drop something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
about her trousseau, and Madame Bourcet
hastened to say that she might take Angéline.</p>

<p>In a little while the two were ready to start.
In her hand Fifi carried a little purse, containing
twenty-one francs, and in her reticule she carried
her handkerchief, her smelling-salts and ten crisp
thousand-franc notes.</p>

<p>“How shall I ever spend it all!” she thought,
with a little dismay; and then, having some curious
odds and ends of sense in her pretty head, she concluded:
“Oh, it is easy enough. I have often heard
Cartouche say that nobody ever yet tried to squander
money who did not find a dozen helpers on
every hand.”</p>

<p>Paris is beautiful on a spring morning, with the
sun shining on the splashing fountains and the
steel blue river, and the streets full of cheerful-looking
people. It was the first, mild, soft day of March,
and everybody was trying to make believe it was
May. The restaurants had placed their chairs and
tables out of doors, and made a brave showing of
greenery with watercress and a few little radishes.
Itinerant musicians were grinding away industriously,
and some humorous cab-drivers had paid
five centimes for a sprig of green to stick behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>the ears of their patient horses. All Paris was
out of doors, helping the birds and leaves to make
the spring.</p>

<p>Fifi strolled along and found the streets almost
as pleasant as the street of the Black Cat, except
that she knew everybody in the street of the Black
Cat and knew no one at all of all this merry
throng. Her first incursion was into a chocolate
shop, where she treated both herself and Angéline
in a princely manner, as became a lady who had
ten notes of a thousand francs to dispose of in a
morning’s shopping.</p>

<p>While they were sipping their chocolate Fifi was
wondering how she could manage to leave Angéline
in the lurch and slip off by herself&mdash;for Angéline
might possibly make trouble for her when she
came to dispensing her wealth as she privately
planned. But in this, as in all things else that day,
fortune favored Fifi. Afar off was heard the rataplan
of a marching regiment, with the merry
laughter and shuffle of feet of an accompanying
crowd.</p>

<p>“What so easy as to get carried along with that
crowd?” thought Fifi, as she ran to the door, where
the proprietor and all the clerks as well as the customers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
were flying. It was the day of a grand review
at Longchamps, and the sight of the marching
regiment, with the band ringing out in rhythmic
beauty, seemed the finest thing in the world.</p>

<p>Fifi found herself, with very little effort on her
part, pushed out on the sidewalk, and the next
thing she was being swept along with the eager
crowd following the soldiers. At the corner of a
large street the regiment turned off toward the
Champs Elysées, the crowd parted, and Fifi saw
her way back clear to the chocolate shop. But
staring her in the face was a magnificent furniture
and bric-à-brac shop, while next it was a superb
<i>magasin des modes</i> with a great window full of
gowns, wraps and hats.</p>

<p>Here was the place for Fifi to get rid of her ten
thousand francs. It seemed to Fifi as if a benignant
Providence had rewarded her virtuous design
by placing her just where she was; so she walked
boldly into the <i>magasin des modes</i>.</p>

<p>The manager of the place, a handsome, showily-dressed
and bejeweled woman, looked suspiciously
at a young and pretty girl, arriving without maid
or companion of any sort&mdash;but Fifi, bringing into
play some of the arts she had learned at the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Theater, sank, apparently breathless, into a
seat; told of her being swept away from her companion,
and offered to pay for a messenger to hunt
up Angéline. Meanwhile she artlessly let out that
she was Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, in search of
articles for her trousseau.</p>

<p>Her story was well known; everybody in Paris
had heard of Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, of the
Imperial Theater, who had drawn the first prize in
the lottery, and instantly all was curiosity to see
her and alertness to attend her&mdash;except as to
sending for Angéline. There was an unaccountable
slowness about that, except on the theory
that it would be well to show Fifi some of the creations
of the establishment before the arrival of the
elder person, who might throw cold water on the
prospective purchases. And then began the comedy,
so often enacted in the world, of the cunning
hypocrite being unconsciously the dupe of the supposed
victim.</p>

<p>Fifi was careful to hint that her marriage was
being arranged; and if anything could have added
to Fifi’s joy and satisfaction it was the determination
on the part of the shop people to embody in
her trousseau all the outlandish things they possessed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
This suited Fifi exactly. Louis Bourcet
was as finically particular about colors as he was
about behavior, and both he and Madame Bourcet
were privately determined that Fifi should go
through life in brown gowns with dark green spots,
like the one which had so excited her disgust in the
first instance. Knowing this, Fifi concluded to
administer a series of shocks in every one of her
purchases, and went about to do this with a vim
and thoroughness characteristic of her.</p>

<p>The first gown they showed her nearly made her
scream with delight. It was almost enough to
make Louis Bourcet break their engagement at
sight. It was a costume of a staring yellow brocade,
with large purple flowers on it, and was obviously
intended for a woman nine feet high and
three feet broad&mdash;and Fifi was but a slender twig
of a girl. One huge flower covered her back, and
another her chest, while three or four went around
the vast skirt which trailed a yard behind. The
manager put it on Fifi, while her assistants and fellow
conspirators joined with her in declaring that
the gown was ravishing on Fifi, which it was in a
way.</p>

<p>Fifi paraded solemnly up and down before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>large swinging mirror, surveying herself. She
was a quaint object in the great yellow and purple
gown, and she knew it. Her face broke into a
shower of smiles and dimples.</p>

<p>“It will answer my purpose exactly,” she cried.
This was true, as it was calculated to give Madame
Bourcet, and especially Louis Bourcet, nervous
convulsions.</p>

<p>“Show me a hat to go with it&mdash;the largest hat
you have.”</p>

<p>The hat was produced&mdash;a nightmare, equal to
the yellow and purple brocade. Flowers, beads,
ribbons and feathers weighed it down, but Fifi
demanded more of everything to be put on it, particularly
feathers. When she put the hat on, with
the gown, one of the young women in the establishment
gave a half shriek of something between
a laugh and a scream. A look from the manager
sent the culprit like a shot into the back part of
the shop.</p>

<p>Fifi, gravely examining herself in the glass, declared
she was charmed with her costume and would
wear it on the day of her civil marriage. Then
she demanded a cloak.</p>

<p>“One that would look well on a dowager empress,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
she said with a grand air, knowing she had
ten thousand francs in her pocket.</p>

<p>One was produced which might have looked well
on the dowager empress of China, but scarcely on
an occidental. It was a stupendous stripe of red and
green satin, which might have served for the gridiron
on which Saint Lawrence was broiled alive. It
had large sleeves, which Fifi insisted must be
trimmed with heavy lace and deep fur. In a
twinkling this was fastened on, and Fifi approved.</p>

<p>“And now a fan,” she said.</p>

<p>Dozens of fans were produced, but none of them
preposterous enough to suit Fifi’s purpose and her
costume. At last she compromised on a large pink
one with a couple of birds of paradise on it.</p>

<p>Oh, what a picture was Fifi, parading up and
down before the mirror, and saying to herself:</p>

<p>“I think this will finish him.”</p>

<p>The amount, for the costume, cloak, hat and fan
was nearly two thousand francs. Fifi regretted it
was not more.</p>

<p>“And now,” she said, “some negligées, with rich
effects; you understand.”</p>

<p>Fifi’s taste being pretty well understood in the
establishment by this time, some negligées were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>produced, in which Fifi arrayed herself and looked
like a parroquet. Then came evening gowns.
There was one in particular which Fifi thought
might be the death of the Bourcets. It was a
short, scant, diaphanous Greek costume, which
was so very Greek that it could only have been
worn with propriety in the days of the nymphs,
the fauns and the dryads.</p>

<p>“This, without a petticoat, I am sure, will rid
me of Louis Bourcet,” thought Fifi, “but I must
never let Cartouche see it, or he will kill me.”</p>

<p>Fifi, being fatigued with her exertions&mdash;for her
purchases were calculated to fatigue the eye as
well as the mind, ordered the articles selected to be
sent that day to Madame Bourcet’s.</p>

<p>“And the bill, Mademoiselle?” asked the manager
in a dulcet voice.</p>

<p>“Make it out,” replied Fifi debonairly, “and I
will pay it now.”</p>

<p>There was a pause for the manager and the
clerks to recover their breath, while Fifi sat quite
serene. It did not take a minute for the bill to be
made out, however,&mdash;four thousand, nine hundred
and forty-four francs, twenty-five centimes. Fifi
was cruelly disappointed; she had reckoned on getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
rid of more of her money. But still this was
a beginning, so she handed over five notes of a
thousand francs each, and gravely counted her
change: fifty-five francs, seventy-five centimes.</p>

<p>Then, and then only, was a message sent after
Angéline to the chocolate shop.</p>

<p>But Angéline could not be found. She had seen
Fifi swept away, as she thought, by the crowd, and
had rushed out to join her; but Fifi had no mind
to be caught, and Angéline found herself flopping
about wildly, shrieking at the passers-by, without
any stops whatever between her words:</p>

<p>“Have you seen Mademoiselle Fifi Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti I lost her in the chocolate shop oh
what will Madame Bourcet say good people I am
sure she is lost for good and a hundred thousand
francs in bank and what is to be become of Monsieur
Louis where <i>can</i> Mademoiselle Fifi be?” and
much more of the same sort.</p>

<p>Fifi, however, was half a mile away, and having
exhausted the resources of the shop for gowns,
tripped gaily into the furniture shop next door.</p>

<p>Here, thought Fifi cheerfully, she would be able
to make substantial progress toward getting rid
of Louis Bourcet and marrying Cartouche. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>saw many splendid gilt tables, chairs, divans, cabinets
and the like, which she, with her limited experience
in furniture buying in the street of the
Black Cat, thought must be very dear: some of the
most splendid pieces must cost as much as four
hundred francs, thought innocent Fifi.</p>

<p>But it was not enough for a thing to be expensive;
it must be outrageous in taste and design to
be available for her purpose, and with this in view
she roved around the establishment, attended by a
clerk of lofty manners and a patronizing air. At
last, however, she pounced upon an object worthy
to be classed with the yellow and purple brocade.
This was a huge, blue satin bed, with elaborate gilt
posts, and cornice, vast curtains of lace as well as
satin, cords, tassels, and every other species of ornament
which could be fastened to a bed.</p>

<p>Fifi, who had never seen anything like it before,
gasped in her amazement and delight, the clerk
meanwhile surveying her with an air of condescending
amusement.</p>

<p>Here was the thing to drive Louis Bourcet to
madness, thought Fifi, surveying the bed rapturously.
If she could once get it into the house,
it would be difficult to get it out, it was so large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>and so complex, and so very formidable. Fifi’s
resolution was taken in an instant. She meant to
have it if it cost a thousand francs. She rather resented
the air of patronage with which the clerk explained
the beauties of the bed to her. He seemed
to be saying all the time:</p>

<p>“This is but time wasted. You can never afford
anything so expensive as this.”</p>

<p>Fifi, calling up her talents as an actress, which
were not inconsiderable, accentuated her innocent
and open-mouthed wonder at the size and splendor
of the bed. Then, intending to make a grand
stroke which would paralyze the clerk, she said
coolly:</p>

<p>“I will give you fifteen hundred francs for this
bed.”</p>

<p>The clerk’s nose went into the air.</p>

<p>“I have the honor to inform Mademoiselle that
this bed was made with a view to purchase by the
Empress, but the cost was so great that the Emperor
objected and would not allow the Empress
to buy it. The price is five thousand francs; no
more and no less.”</p>

<p>Fifi was secretly staggered by this, but she
now regarded the clerk as an enemy to be vanquished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
at any price&mdash;and vengeance seemed to her
cheap at five thousand francs. Fifi had a revengeful
nature, which did not stop at trifles. So, after
a moment’s pause to recover herself, she said, still
coolly:</p>

<p>“Well, then, the price is exorbitant, but I will
take the bed.”</p>

<p>The clerk, instead of succumbing to this, retained
his composure in the most exasperating manner.
He only asked, with a shade of incredulity in
his voice:</p>

<p>“If Mademoiselle will kindly give us the money
in gold or notes it can be arranged at once.”</p>

<p>Fifi, in the most debonair manner in the world,
opened her reticule and produced five notes for a
thousand francs each.</p>

<p>The clerk, unlike Fifi, knew nothing of the
art of acting, and looked, as he was, perfectly
astounded. His limp hand fell to his side, his jaw
dropped open and he backed away from Fifi as if
he thought she might explode. Fifi, as calm as a
May zephyr, continued:</p>

<p>“I desire that this bed be sent between ten and
two to-morrow to the address I shall give. I shall
only take it on that condition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>There was method in this. Fifi had suddenly
remembered that the next morning was Thursday.
On that day, every week, Madame Bourcet indulged
in the wild orgy of attending a lecture on mathematics
delivered by her brother, the professor of
mathematics, before a lyceum frequented by several
elderly and mathematical ladies, like Madame
Bourcet. When she was out of the house was
clearly the time to get the preposterous bed in;
and Fifi made her arrangements accordingly.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more impressive than
Fifi’s studied calmness and coolness while giving
directions about the bed. The clerk went after
the proprietor, who could not conceal his surprise
at a young lady like Fifi going about unattended,
and with five thousand francs in her pocket. Fifi
finally condescended to explain that she was Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti. That cleared up everything.
The proprietor, of course, had heard her
story, and rashly and mistakenly assumed that Fifi
was a little fool, but at all events, he had made a
good bargain with her, and he bowed her out of the
establishment as if she had been a princess as well
as a fool.</p>

<p>Once outside in the clear sunshine, Fifi was triumphant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
She felt that a long step had been
taken toward getting rid of Louis Bourcet. And,
after all, it was just as easy to spend five thousand
francs as five, if one has the money. She had spent
infinitely more time and trouble over her thirty-franc
cloak than over all her extraordinary purchases
of the last hour.</p>

<p>“The gowns are frightful enough, as well as the
bills,” she thought to herself, walking away from
the shop, “and the bed is really a crushing revelation&mdash;but
it is not enough&mdash;it is not enough.”</p>

<p>Then an inspiration came to her which brought
her to a standstill.</p>

<p>“I must go to a monkey shop and buy a monkey&mdash;but&mdash;but
I am afraid of monkeys. However&mdash;”&mdash;here
Fifi felt an expansion of the soul&mdash;“when
one loves, as I love Cartouche, one must be prepared
for sacrifices. So I shall sacrifice myself. I shall
buy a monkey.”</p>

<p>But it is easier to say one will buy a monkey
than to buy one. Fifi walked on, pondering how to
make this sublime sacrifice to her affections.</p>

<p>The sense of freedom, the exhilaration of the
spring day, made themselves felt in her blood. And
then, for the first time, she also felt the berserker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>madness for shopping which is latent in the feminine
nature. The fact that reason and common
sense were to be outraged as far as possible rather
added zest to the enjoyment.</p>

<p>“This is the real way to go shopping,” thought
Fifi, with delight. “Spending for the pleasure of
spending&mdash;buying monkeys and everything else
one fancies. It can only be done once in a blue
moon; even the Empress can not do it whenever
she likes.”</p>

<p>She walked on, drinking in with delight the life
and sunshine around her. The more she reflected
upon the monkey idea the finer it appeared to her.
True, she was mortally afraid of a monkey, but
then she was convinced that Louis Bourcet was more
afraid of monkeys than she was.</p>

<p>“And it is for my Cartouche&mdash;and would Cartouche
hesitate at making such a sacrifice for me?
No! A thousand times no! And I can not do
less than all for Cartouche, whom I love. It is my
duty to use every means, even a monkey, to get rid
of Louis Bourcet.”</p>

<p>But where should she find a place to buy a
monkey? That she could not think of, but her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>fertile mind suggested an expedient even better
than the mere purchase of a single monkey. She
stopped at one of those movable booths, wherein
sat a man who did writing for those unable to write
as well as they wished, or unable to write at all.
The booth was plastered over with advertisements
of articles for sale, but naturally no monkeys were
offered.</p>

<p>The man in the booth, a bright-eyed cripple,
looked up when Fifi tapped on the glass of the little
open window.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said Fifi, sweetly, “if you please, I
am very anxious for a monkey&mdash;a dear little
monkey, for a pet; but I do not know where to
find one, and my family will not assist me in finding
one. If I should pay you, say five francs, would
you write an advertisement for a monkey, and let
it be pasted with the other advertisements on your
booth?”</p>

<p>“Ten francs,” responded the man.</p>

<p>Fifi laid the ten francs down.</p>

<p>“Now, write in very large letters: ‘Wanted&mdash;A
monkey, for a lady’s pet; must be well trained,
and not malicious. Apply at No. 14 Rue de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>l’Echelle. Any person bringing a monkey will receive
a franc for his trouble, if the monkey is not
purchased.’”</p>

<p>“Do you wish any snakes or parrots, Mademoiselle?”
asked the man, pocketing his ten francs.</p>

<p>“No, thank you; the monkey, I think, will answer
all my purposes,” responded Fifi with dignity.</p>

<p>It was then past noon, and Fifi, having spent
a most enjoyable morning, called a fiacre and directed
the cabman to take her home.</p>

<p>Just as she turned into the Rue de l’Echelle she
heard some one calling after her:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle Fifi!”</p>

<p>It was Angéline, very red in the face, and running
after the fiacre. Fifi had it stopped and Angéline
clambered in. Before she had a chance to
begin the fault-finding which is the privilege of an
old servant Fifi cut the ground from under her
feet.</p>

<p>“Why did you desert me as you did, Angéline?”
cried Fifi indignantly. “You saw me swept off my
feet, and carried along with the crowd, and instead
of following me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I did not see you, Mademoiselle&mdash;it was you&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“You left me to my fate! What might not have
happened to me alone in the streets of Paris!”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle has perhaps been alone in the
streets of Paris before&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence, Angéline! How dare you say that I
have been alone in the streets of Paris before!
Your language, as well as your conduct, is intolerable!”</p>

<p>“I beg Mademoiselle to remember&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I remember nothing but that, being sent out
in your charge, you basely deserted me, and you
shall answer for it; I beg of you to remember that.”</p>

<p>Angéline was reduced by this tirade to surly
silence, and, not bearing in mind that Fifi was
really a very clever little actress, actually thought
she was in a boiling rage. Fifi was meanwhile
laughing in her sleeve.</p>

<span class="smaller">A MOST IMPRUDENT THING</span></h2></div>

<p>Madame Bourcet sat in the snuff-colored drawing-room,
nursing her rheumatism, when in walked
Fifi as demure as the cat after it has eaten the
canary. She mentioned casually that she had
bought a few things for her trousseau, and Madame
Bourcet presumed that the sum total of expenditure
was something like a hundred francs. Still,
with visions of the pink spangled gown which Fifi
wished to buy for her presentation to the Holy
Father, Madame Bourcet thought it well to say,
warningly:</p>

<p>“I hope your purchases were of a sober and substantial
character, warranted to wear well, and in
quiet colors.”</p>

<p>“Wait, Madame, until you see them,” was Fifi’s
diplomatic answer.</p>

<p>As soon as she could, she escaped to her own
room, and, locking the door, she opened her precious
trunk with the relics of her theatrical life in
it, and began to handle them tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you dear old wig, how happy I was when
I wore you!” she said to herself, clapping the white
wig over her own rich brown hair. “When I put
you on I became a marquise at the court of Louis
le Grand, and how fine it seemed! Never mind, I
shall be a marquise again, and get forty francs the
week at least! And how nice it will be to be quarreling
with Julie Campionet again, the wretch!
And Duvernet&mdash;I shall not forget to remind him of
how I gave him my best white cotton petticoat for
his toga&mdash;and sewed it with my own fingers, too!
And I shall say to him, ‘Recollect, Monsieur, I am
no longer Fifi, but Mademoiselle Josephine Chiaramonti,
granddaughter of the cousin of a reigning
sovereign, and I am the young lady who won the
grand prize in the lottery, and spent it all; you
never had a leading lady before who knew how to
spend a hundred thousand francs.’ I think I can
see Duvernet now&mdash;and as I say it I shall toy with
my paste brooch. I can’t buy any jewels, for
that wouldn’t help me to get rid of Louis Bourcet,
or to get Cartouche; so I shall tell Duvernet that
nothing in the way of diamonds seemed worth
while after those I had already.”</p>

<p>Fifi fondled her paste brooch, which was kept in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>the same shrine as the white wig, and then she
clasped to her breast Cartouche’s javelin, made
from a broomstick, and it seemed to her almost as
if she were clasping Cartouche. It put the notion
into her head to write him a letter, so she hastily
closed her trunk, and sat down to write.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cartouche, I went out this morning, and spent
ten thousand francs of that odious money I won
through that abominable lottery ticket you gave
me. I should think you would never cease reproaching
yourself if you knew how miserable that
lottery ticket has made me. I bought some of the
most terrible gowns you ever saw, and a bed that
cost five thousand francs, and which the Empress
couldn’t buy. I shall tell poor Louis and Madame
Bourcet that these gowns are for my trousseau&mdash;but,
of course, I have not the slightest idea of marrying
Louis. I made up my mind not to last night,
the very moment I promised&mdash;and so I wrote to you
before I slept. It is not at all difficult to spend
money; it is as easy to spend five thousand francs
for a bed as five, if you have the money. And I had
the money in my reticule. I shan’t tell you now
how I got it, but I did, just the same, Cartouche.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>I long to see you. I did something for you to-day
that I would not do for any one else in the world.
You know how afraid I am of monkeys? Well,
I can not explain in a letter, but you will be pleased
when I tell you all.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fifi.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was not Louis Bourcet’s habit to appear in
his aunt’s apartment until eight o’clock, but at six
o’clock, seeing a great van drawn up before the
door, from which was disgorged innumerable large
parcels addressed to his fiancée, Louis, like other
good men, was vanquished by his curiosity. He
mounted the stairs, on which he was jostled at every
step by men carrying huge pasteboard boxes of
every size and shape, all addressed to Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti.</p>

<p>Fifi stood, with a brightly smiling face, at the
head of the stairs, directing the parcels to be carried
into her own room. Louis, after speaking to
her, ventured to say:</p>

<p>“The cost of your purchases must be very
great.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Fifi, merrily, “but when one is
about to make a grand marriage, such as I am,
one should have good clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Louis Bourcet, thus openly tickled under the
fifth rib, smiled rather anxiously, and replied:</p>

<p>“But one should be prudent, Mademoiselle. An
extravagant wife would give me a great deal of
pain.”</p>

<p>“Ah, a woman happy enough to be married to
you could not give you a moment’s pain,” cried Fifi
tenderly.</p>

<p>Louis started and blushed deeply,&mdash;this open
lovemaking was a new thing, and very embarrassing,&mdash;but
it is difficult to tell the lady in the case
that she is too demonstrative.</p>

<p>Fifi, with a truly impish intelligence, saw at a
glance the misery she could inflict upon poor Louis
by her demonstrations of affection, and the discovery
filled her with unholy joy, particularly as
Madame Bourcet, sitting in the snuff-colored drawing-room,
was within hearing through the open
door.</p>

<p>“Only wait,” cried Fifi, as she skipped into her
own room; “only wait until you see me in these
things I bought to-day, and you will be as much in
love with me as I am with you!”</p>

<p>Louis, blushing redder than any beet that ever
grew, entered the snuff-colored drawing-room and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>closed the door after him. Madame Bourcet’s
countenance showed that she had heard every word.</p>

<p>“In my day,” said she, in a severe tone, “young
ladies did not fall in love with their fiancés, much
less proclaim the fact.”</p>

<p>Louis shifted uncomfortably in his chair.</p>

<p>“We must make allowances, Aunt, for Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti’s early training&mdash;and we
must not forget that her grandfather was cousin
to His Holiness, and Mademoiselle has a hundred
thousand francs of her own.” Louis mentally
added, “and a hundred thousand francs is not
picked up with every girl.”</p>

<p>“She will not have a hundred thousand francs
if she goes shopping like this very often,” stiffly
replied Madame Bourcet. “I should not be surprised
if she had squandered all of a thousand
francs in one day.”</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and a tremendous hat,
with eleven large feathers on it, and much else besides,
appeared. Fifi’s delicate bright face, now
as solemn as a judge’s, was seen under this huge
creation. The red and green striped satin cloak,
with the large lace and fur-trimmed sleeves, concealed
some of the yellow brocade with the big
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>purple flowers, but some yards of it were visible,
trailing on the floor. The bird of paradise fan
and a muff the size of a barrel completed Fifi’s
costume.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet gave a faint scream and Louis
almost jumped out of his chair at the show. Fifi,
parading solemnly up and down, surveying herself
complacently, remarked:</p>

<p>“This is the costume I shall wear when we pay
our visit of ceremony to the Holy Father, upon my
marriage.”</p>

<p>A dead pause followed. Both Madame Bourcet
and Louis were too stunned to speak. Fifi, seeing
to what a state they were reduced, returned to her
room, and being an expert in quick changes of costume,
reappeared in a few minutes wearing one of
the violently sensational negligées, in which she
looked like a living rainbow.</p>

<p>Neither Madame Bourcet nor Louis knew what
to say at this catastrophe, and therefore said nothing.
But Fifi was voluble enough for both. She
harangued on the beauty of the costumes, and
their extraordinary cheapness, without mentioning
the price, and claimed to have a gem of a gown to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>exhibit, which would eclipse anything she had yet
shown.</p>

<p>When she went to put this marvelous creation on,
Madame Bourcet recovered speech enough to say:</p>

<p>“A thousand francs, I said a few minutes ago&mdash;two
thousand I say now. Only ninety-eight thousand
francs of her fortune is left&mdash;of that I am
sure.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure there is so much left,” responded
Louis gloomily.</p>

<p>The door opened and a vision appeared. It was
Fifi in the spangled white ball gown <i>à la grecque</i>.
The narrow, scanty skirt did not reach to her ankles.
The waist, according to the fashion of the time,
was under her arms, and the bodice was about four
inches long. There were no sleeves, only tiny
straps across Fifi’s white arms; and her whole outfit
could have been put in Louis Bourcet’s waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet fell back in her chair, with a
groan. Louis rose, red and furious, and said in
portentous tones:</p>

<p>“You will excuse me, Mademoiselle, if I retire
behind the screen while you remain with that costume
on in my presence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Do you want me to take it off then?” asked
Fifi airily; but Louis was already behind the
screen.</p>

<p>“Aunt,” he called out sternly, “kindly let me
know when Mademoiselle Chiaramonti has retired.”</p>

<p>“I can not,” responded Madame Bourcet, briefly,
“for I shall myself retire.” And Madame Bourcet
marched away to her own room.</p>

<p>“Louis,” said a timid, tender little voice, “don’t
you think this gown more suitable to wear than the
yellow brocade when we go to pay our visit of ceremony
to the Holy Father?”</p>

<p>Louis Bourcet was near choking with wrath at
this. What right had she to call him Louis? He
had never asked her to do so&mdash;their engagement
was not even formally announced; he had never
spoken to her or of her except as Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti. And that gown to go visiting the
Holy Father!</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” replied Louis in a voice of thunder,
still from behind the screen, “I consider that
gown wholly improper for you to appear before
any one in, myself included.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Just come and take a look at it,” pleaded Fifi.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="350" alt="Fifi scandalizing the Bourcets."
title=""  /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p class="p2">“I will not, Mademoiselle; and I give you warning
I am now about to leave this room.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would contrive to get a look at
me, and not stick behind that screen,” remarked
Fifi, with a sudden explosion of laughter, as Louis
stalked from behind the screen. But the injustice
and impropriety of her remark was emphasized by
his indignantly turning his head away from her as
he made for the door.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Fifi, impishly, “you can see me perfectly
well in the mirror, with your head turned
that way!”</p>

<p>An angry bang of the door after him was Louis
Bourcet’s only answer to this.</p>

<p>Fifi surveyed herself in the mirror which she had
accused the innocent Louis of studying.</p>

<p>“This gown is perfectly outrageous, and it would
be as much as my life is worth to let Cartouche see
it,” she thought. “But if only it can frighten off
that odious, ridiculous thing, how happy I shall
be!”</p>

<p>Fifi retired to her room. Eight o’clock was
the hour when tea was served in the drawing-room,
and both Madame Bourcet and Louis appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>on the scene inwardly uncomfortable as to the
meeting with Fifi. There sat Fifi, but without
the least appearance of discomfort; on the contrary,
more smiling and more at ease than they
had ever seen her. The door to her bedroom was
open, and as soon as Madame Bourcet and Louis
entered they were saluted by an overwhelming odor
of burning. Madame Bourcet, who was a fire-fiend,
shrieked at once:</p>

<p>“Something is on fire! Go, go, inform the police;
fetch some water, and let me faint!”</p>

<p>“There isn’t the least danger,” cried Fifi; “it is
only my improper ball gown which is burning in my
grate.” And they saw, through the open door,
the ball gown stuffed in the grate, in which a fire
was smoldering. Some pieces of coal were piled
upon it, to keep it from blazing up, and it was
being slowly consumed, with perfect safety to the
surroundings and an odor as if a warehouse were
afire.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet concluded not to faint, and she
and Louis stood staring at each other. But they
were not the only ones to be startled. The other
tenants in the house had taken the alarm, and the
bell in Madame Bourcet’s lobby was being frantically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
pulled. Fifi ran and opened the door.
There stood Doctor Mailly, the eminent surgeon,
who had the apartment above the Bourcet’s; Colonel
and Madame Bruart, who lived in the apartment
below, and about half a dozen others of the
highly respectable persons who inhabited this
highly respectable house.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Fifi, in the tone of
easy confidence which the stage had bred in her,
“there is nothing whatever to be alarmed about. I
am simply burning up a gown which Monsieur
Louis Bourcet, my fiancé, objected to&mdash;and as&mdash;as&mdash;I
am madly in love with him, I destroy the gown
in order to win his approval. Can any of you&mdash;at
least those who know what it is to love and be
beloved&mdash;think me wrong?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence. Louis Bourcet, his
face crimson, advanced and said sternly to Fifi:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I desire to say that I consider
your conduct in regard to the gown most uncalled
for, most sensational and wholly opposed to my
wishes.”</p>

<p>“So you wanted to see me wear it again, did
you?” cried Fifi, roguishly; and then, relapsing
into a sentimental attitude, she said: “But you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>don’t know how much pleasure it gives me to sacrifice
that gown for you, dear Louis.”</p>

<p>At this, Louis Bourcet, with a flaming face, replied:</p>

<p>“I beg of you, Mademoiselle, not to call me
Louis; and your expressions of endearment are as
unpleasant to me as they are improper.”</p>

<p>The lookers-on began to laugh, and turned away,
except Colonel Bruart, a fat old retired cavalry
colonel, on whom a pretty face never failed of its
effect.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he cried gallantly, “if I were
as young as your fiancé, you might call me all the
endearing names in the dictionary and I wouldn’t
complain. Is this young gentleman a Frenchman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur,” replied Fifi, sweetly.</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Colonel Bruart, turning his
broad back on the scene, “I am glad there are not
many like him. Adieu, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>Fifi, Madame Bourcet and Louis returned to the
drawing-room. The Bourcets were stupefied. Fifi
was evidently a dangerous person to adopt into a
family, but a hundred thousand francs is a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>deal of money. Fifi, by way of administering a
final shock, said:</p>

<p>“Anyway, the gown only cost five hundred
francs, and that seemed to me little enough to
pay for pleasing you, Louis. And yet, you do not
seem pleased.”</p>

<p>“I am not,” responded Louis, who found Fifi’s
singular endearments as trying as her clothes.</p>

<p>The evening passed with the utmost constraint
on every one except Fifi, who was entirely at her
ease and in great spirits.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet and Louis each spent a sleepless
night, and next morning held a council of war
in Madame Bourcet’s bedroom. Another startling
thought had occurred to them: where did
Fifi get the money to pay for the outlandish
things? On each parcel Madame Bourcet had
noted the mark “Paid.” Fifi had not gone to the
bank; and yet, she must have had several thousand
francs in hand. Possibly, she had more than a
hundred thousand francs. The Holy Father might
have presented her with a considerable sum of
money the day he had the long interview with her.</p>

<p>There were many perplexing surmises; and, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>last, wearied with their anxieties, both Madame
Bourcet and Louis resolved that Madame Bourcet,
after attending her brother’s lecture, should
consult that eminent man, as an expert in managing
heiresses. It had become a very serious
question as to whether Fifi should be admitted into
the Bourcet family or not, but then, there was the
money!</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet was not expected to return
before half-past two, as her conference with
the professor was to take place after the lecture;
but at two o’clock, precisely, Louis Bourcet appeared.
He had spent an anxious morning.
Whichever way the cat might jump would be disastrous
for him. If he went on with the marriage,
he was likely to die of shock at some of Fifi’s vagaries;
and if the marriage were declared off, there
was a hundred thousand francs, and possibly more,
gone, to say nothing of the last chance of being
allied to a reigning sovereign. Poor Louis was beset
with all the troubles of the over-righteous man.</p>

<p>As he entered the drawing-room, Fifi, dressed in
the yellow brocade, which looked more weird than
ever by daylight, ran forward to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“How glad I am that you have come!” she cried.
“I have something beautiful to show you. Look!”</p>

<p>She threw wide her bedroom door, and there,
filling up half the large room, stood the gorgeous
blue satin and gold bed.</p>

<p>Louis was stricken dumb. He had never seen
such a machine before, but being a practical person
he saw at a glance its costliness. He opened
his mouth to speak, but no words came. However,
Fifi remarked rapturously:</p>

<p>“It was made for the Empress, but the Emperor,
thinking the price too much, refused to take
it; and it was only five thousand francs, too!”</p>

<p>Then, running and exhibiting the lace, the gilt
tassels and other paraphernalia of the bed, Fifi
concluded with saying:</p>

<p>“Of course, I shan’t sleep in it&mdash;it’s much too
fine. I don’t think it was ever meant to be slept
in&mdash;but see&mdash;” Here Fifi raised the valance, and
showed her own mattress, which she had substantial
reasons for holding on to, “that’s what I shall
sleep on! No one shall call <i>me</i> extravagant!”</p>

<p>Louis retreated to the drawing-room. Fifi followed
him, shutting the door carefully after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Just then there was a commotion and a scuffle
heard outside, in the lobby, and Angéline’s shrill
voice raised high.</p>

<p>“That must be the monkeys!” cried Fifi, running
out.</p>

<p>Two Italians, each with a robust-looking monkey,
were squabbling on the stairs with Angéline.
The Italians, each bent on getting in first, had
begun a scuffle which was growing perilously near
a fight. Neither paid the slightest attention to
Angéline’s fierce demand that they and their monkeys
take themselves off. When Fifi appeared,
both of the monkey venders burst into voluble explanations
and denunciations. Fifi, however, had
lost something of her cool courage. In her heart
she was afraid of monkeys, and had not meant to
let them get so far as the drawing-room door.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she cried to the Italians, thinking to
pacify both of them, “here is a franc apiece for
your trouble, and take the monkeys away. I don’t
think either will suit.”</p>

<p>“No!” shrieked both of the Italians in chorus.
“We have brought our monkeys and Mademoiselle
must at least examine them.”</p>

<p>This was anything but an agreeable proposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>to Fifi; nor was she reassured by each of the Italians
declaring vehemently that his rival’s monkey
was as fierce as a lion and a disgrace to the simian
tribe. Fifi secretly thought that both of them were
telling the truth in that respect, and totally disbelieved
them when each swore that his own monkey
was a companion fit for kings. All Fifi could
do, therefore, was to say, with an assumption of
bravado:</p>

<p>“I will give you each two francs if you will go
away and bring the monkeys to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Three francs!” shouted one of her compatriots,
while the other bawled, “Five francs!”</p>

<p>Fifi had as much as ten francs about her, so she
gladly paid the ten francs, and the Italians departed,
each swearing he would come the next day,
and would, meanwhile, have the other’s blood.</p>

<p>Fifi returned to the drawing-room. On the
hearth-rug stood Louis, pale and determined.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, “there must be an end
of this.”</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked Fifi, innocently.</p>

<p>“Either of the performances of yesterday and
to-day, or of our arrangement to marry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“O-o-o-h!” wailed Fifi, “just as I had fallen so
beautifully in love with you!”</p>

<p>Louis’s face turned paler still.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I do not know how to take such
speeches.”</p>

<p>“I see you don’t,” replied Fifi.</p>

<p>“It is the first time I have ever been thrown with
a young person of your profession,” began Louis.</p>

<p>“Or with an heiress worth a hundred thousand
francs, and the relative of a reigning sovereign&mdash;”
added Fifi, maliciously.</p>

<p>Louis hesitated, and changed from one foot to
the other. It was hardly likely that the Holy
Father would let so desirable a match for his young
relative escape. Louis’s esteem for himself was
as tall as the Vendôme column, and he naturally
thought everybody took him at his own valuation.
The Holy Father’s possible attitude in the matter
was alarming and disconcerting to poor Louis.</p>

<p>“And besides,” added Fifi, “your attentions have
been compromising. Do you recall, Monsieur&mdash;since
you forbid me to call you Louis&mdash;that you
have played a game of cribbage with me every
evening since I have lived under your aunt’s
charge? Is that nothing? Is my reputation to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>sacrificed to your love of cribbage? Do you suppose
that I shall let my relative, the Holy Father,
remain in ignorance of those games of cribbage?
Beware, Monsieur Louis Bourcet, that you are not
made to repent of the heartless way in which you
entrapped my affections at the cribbage-board.”</p>

<p>And Fifi walked with great dignity into her
bedroom and banged the door after her. Once
inside, she opened her arms wide and whispered
softly:</p>

<p>“Cartouche! Cartouche! You will not be any
such lover as this creature!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madame Bourcet had returned from
her conference with her brother. Angéline had met
her on the stairs with a gruesome tale of the blue
satin bed, and the two monkeys, who had been invited
to call the next day. It was too much for
Madame Bourcet. She dropped on a chair as
soon as she reached the drawing-room. There
Louis Bourcet burst forth with his account, of the
blue satin bed and the monkeys, adding many harrowing
details omitted by Angéline.</p>

<p>“And what does my uncle say?” he asked,
gloomily.</p>

<p>“He says,” replied Madame Bourcet, more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>gloomily, “that Mademoiselle Chiaramonti’s conduct
is such as to drive any prudent man to distraction;
and that if you marry her with even
more than a hundred thousand francs’ fortune, you
will be doing a most imprudent thing.”</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet paused for Louis to digest this.
Then, she continued, after an impressive pause:</p>

<p>“And my brother also says, and desired me particularly
to impress this upon you&mdash;that a <i>dot</i>
of a hundred thousand francs is something enormous
in our station of life; that he does not
know of a single acquaintance of his own who has
been so fortunate as to marry so much; and his
own good fortune in marrying two hundred thousand
francs is absolutely unprecedented. Moreover,
through Mademoiselle Chiaramonti’s connection
with the Holy Father, your prospects, no
doubt, would be splendidly advanced; and to
throw away such a chance would be&mdash;a most imprudent
thing.”</p>

<p>So all the comfort poor Louis got was, that, whatever
he did, he would be doing a most imprudent
thing. The knowledge of this made him a truly
miserable man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AN OLD LADY AND A LIMP</span></h2></div>

<p>Nearly a week passed, with the utmost constraint,
upon the little family in the Rue de l’Echelle, except
Fifi. Nothing could equal the airy <i>insouciance</i>
of that young woman. She was no more
the dumb, docile creature whose soul and spirit
seemed frozen, whose will was benumbed, but
Mademoiselle Fifi of the Imperial Theater. Fifi
delighted in acting&mdash;and she was now acting in
her own drama, and with the most exquisite enjoyment
of the situation.</p>

<p>At intervals, during the week, Italians with monkeys
appeared; but Angéline adopted with these
gentry a simple, but effective, method of her own,
which was secretly approved by Fifi. This was to
appear suddenly on the scene with a kettle of boiling
water, which she threatened to distribute impartially
upon the monkeys and their owners. This
never failed to stampede the enemy. Fifi scolded
and complained bitterly of this, but Angéline took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>a firm stand against monkeys and Italians&mdash;much
to Fifi’s relief.</p>

<p>The subject of Fifi’s marriage to Louis was not
touched upon by either Madame Bourcet or Louis
in that week, although Louis continued to spend
his evenings with his aunt and Fifi, and did not
intermit the nightly game of cribbage. If it was
imprudent to marry Fifi, it was likewise imprudent
not to marry her&mdash;so reasoned the unhappy Louis,
who, like Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was of two
minds at the same time, and fairly distracted between
them.</p>

<p>But, if the Bourcets let the marriage question
remain discreetly in the background, not so Fifi.
Having discovered that Louis suffered acutely
from her manifestations of affection, Fifi proceeded
to subject him to a form of torture in high repute
among the most bloodthirsty savages of North
America. This consists in smearing the victim’s
body all over with honey, and then letting him be
slowly stung to death by gnats and flies. Figuratively
speaking, she smeared poor Louis with honey
from his head to his heels, and then had a delicious
joy in seeing him writhe under his agonies. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>the innocence and simplicity with which she did it
fooled the unfortunate Louis completely.</p>

<p>One thing seemed clear to him: even if the Holy
Father were willing to give up so desirable a husband
for his young relative, Fifi, herself, would
have to be reckoned with; and it all came, Louis
thought, with a rainbow of vanity athwart the
gloom, of his being so dreadfully handsome, fascinating
and virtuous.</p>

<p>To Fifi this was the comedy part of the drama&mdash;and
she played it for all there was in it.</p>

<p>She reckoned the shopping episode as the first
act of the play. That was through, and there must
be a second act. Fifi was too much of an artist
to repeat herself. She felt she had reached the
limit of horrors in shopping, and she still had
nearly ninety thousand francs sewed up in her mattress.
Some new way must be devised for getting
rid of it. She thought of endowing beds in hospitals,
of giving <i>dots</i> to young ladies, not so fortunate
as herself in having a man like Cartouche,
who declined a fortune&mdash;and a thousand other
schemes; but all involved some vague and mysterious
business transactions which frightened Fifi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>But, by a turn of fate, most unexpected, it was
Cartouche who showed her a way out of her difficulties,
and it filled her with delight. It was in a letter
Cartouche wrote her in response to the two she had
sent him, one after the other. Cartouche’s letter
was written in very black ink, in a large, slovenly
hand, on a big sheet of paper, and Fifi knew perfectly
well that he was in a rage when writing it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Fifi: What nonsense is this you write me, that
as soon as you promised to marry Louis Bourcet
you determined not to marry him? What have you
been doing? Don’t you know if you squander
your money neither Louis Bourcet nor any man
of his class will marry you? Four thousand francs
for your trousseau is outrageous; as for the blue-satin
bed the Empress could not buy, I can not
trust myself to speak of it. If you continue acting
in this way, I will not come to your wedding, nor
let Toto come&mdash;that is, if Monsieur Bourcet or any
other man will marry you. You seem to be bitten
with the desire to do everything the Empress does,
and a little more besides. You might follow the
Empress’ example, and going in your coach and
six, with outriders, to the banking-house of Lafitte,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>make a little gift of a hundred thousand francs to
the fund for soldiers’ orphans. Fifi, you are a
goose, and there is no disguising it. I hope Monsieur
Bourcet will use the strong hand on you, for
your own good.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Cartouche.</p>

<p>“P. S. I could tell you many interesting things
about Toto, but I am so angry I can not write any
more.”</p></div>

<p>Fifi read this letter over, with a serene smile.
Of course Cartouche was angry&mdash;but that was
rather amusing.</p>

<p>She laid the letter down, and looked up at the
patch of blue sky visible from her bedroom window.
She seemed to see in that blue patch all her
former life, so full of work, of makeshifts, of
gaiety, of vivid interest&mdash;and compared with it
the dull and spiritless existence before her&mdash;that
is, which had lately been before her; because now
the determination to return to the old life was as
strong as the soul within her.</p>

<p>She took Cartouche’s letter up and read it again,
and a cry of joy came from her lips. Give the
money to the soldiers’ fund! She remembered having
heard Madame Bourcet and Louis speaking of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>this fund the night before. The Empress had
gone in state, as Cartouche said, to make her
splendid gift&mdash;and Lafitte’s banking-house was not
fifteen minutes from where she was in the Rue de
l’Echelle.</p>

<p>In a flash, Fifi saw she could do it. She had her
white wig and outside of her door was the press in
which Angéline kept her best black bonnet, black
shawl and gown, in which any woman could look a
hundred years old. Oh, it was the simplest thing in
the world! The next day was Thursday, the morning
Madame Bourcet always went out, and Angéline
always stayed at home. It could be done
within twenty-four hours!</p>

<p>Fifi danced about her room in rapture. It was
now late in the afternoon; she could scarcely wait
until the next day. How precious was her white
wig to her then!</p>

<p>“Cartouche said I was silly to bring all these
things with me,” she said to herself gleefully;
“and I had to do it secretly&mdash;but see, how sensible
I was! The fact is, I have a great deal of sense,
and I know what is good for me, much better than
Cartouche does, or the Bourcets, or the Emperor,
or even the Holy Father. How do they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>know what is going on inside of my head? Only
I know perfectly well. And to think that Cartouche
should have suggested such a good way for
me to get rid of the hateful money! What an advertisement
it will be! Mademoiselle Chiaramonti,
granddaughter of the Pope’s cousin, winner of the
first prize in the grand lottery, and giving ninety
thousand francs to the soldiers’ orphans! Mademoiselle
Mars, at the Théâtre Française, never had
half such an advertisement. She has only her art
to advertise her! I shall be worth fifty francs the
week to any manager in Paris. No doubt the high-priced
theaters will try to get me, and all the people
who think they know, like the Emperor and
the Holy Father, would say I should go to a theater
on the other side of the river. But I do not
understand the style of acting at the high-priced
theaters. I should be hissed. No. The cheap theaters
for me, and the kings and queens and Roman
consuls and things like that. Oh, Fifi, what a
clever, clever creature you are!”</p>

<p>The happier Fifi was the more she loved to torment
Louis Bourcet, and she was so very demonstrative
that night, and made so many allusions to
the bliss she expected to enjoy with him, that both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>Louis and Madame Bourcet were half distracted.
But Fifi had such a lot of money&mdash;and was the
granddaughter of the Holy Father’s cousin!</p>

<p>Next morning, Madame Bourcet, as usual, made
ready to go to the lecture, at twelve o’clock. Fifi
had never once proposed going out alone, and was
at that moment engaged in needlework in her own
room. Madame Bourcet, therefore, started off,
without any misgivings, except the general gloom
produced by the thought of either having Fifi in
the family, or not having her.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Madame Bourcet’s respectable figure
disappeared around the corner, before another
figure equally respectable, and apparently a good
deal older, emerged upon the street. It was Fifi,
dressed in Angéline’s clothes, and with a green
barége veil falling over her face. She knew how
to limp as if she were seventy-five, instead of nineteen,
and cleverly concealed her mouthful of beautiful
white teeth. On her arm was a little covered
basket which might have held eggs, but which
really held nearly ninety thousand francs in thousand-franc
notes.</p>

<p>Fifi knew the way to the banking-house of Lafitte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
perfectly well. It was then in a great gloomy
building in the Rue St. Jacques. In less than fifteen
minutes she was mounting the steps, and soon
found herself in a large room, around which was an
iron grating, and behind this grating were innumerable
clerks at work.</p>

<p>Fifi went to the window nearest the door, and
asked of a very alert-looking young clerk, at work
at the desk:</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough, Monsieur, to tell me
where I can make a contribution to the fund for
the soldiers’ orphans?”</p>

<p>“Here, Madame,” replied the young clerk, eying
superciliously the little basket Fifi laid down
on the ledge before him. People made all sorts of
contributions to this fund, and the spruce young
clerk had several times had his sensibilities outraged
by offerings of old shoes, of assignats, even
of a live cock. The basket before him looked as
if it held a cat&mdash;probably one of the rare kind,
which the old lady would propose that he should
sell, and give the proceeds to the fund. Out of the
basket the white-haired old lady with the green
barége veil took a parcel, and laying it down, said
humbly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“Monsieur, this gift comes from one who has no
husband and no son to give to the empire.”</p>

<p>“To whom shall I make out the receipt, and for
how much, Madame?” asked the clerk; but the old
lady was already out of the room, and going down
the steps much faster than one would expect a
person of her age to be able to do.</p>

<p>Once outside Fifi stepped into a dark archway,
from which she emerged, a minute later, wearing
her own bonnet and red cloak and her own skirt.
All of Angéline’s paraphernalia, together with the
white wig, was squeezed into a bundle which Fifi
cleverly concealed under her cloak. The basket
she had tossed down an open cellar under the archway.</p>

<p>She called a closed cab, and stuffing her bundle
under the seat, ordered the cabman to drive her in
a direction which she knew would take her past
the bank. She had the exquisite pleasure of seeing
half a dozen clerks rush distractedly out, inquiring
frantically if any one had seen in the neighborhood
an old lady with a limp, a green veil and a
basket. Fifi stopped her cab long enough to get a
description of herself from one of the wildest-looking
of the clerks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“But why, Monsieur, do you wish to find this
old lady?” Fifi asked.</p>

<p>“Because, Mademoiselle, she has stolen ninety
thousand francs from this bank a moment ago or
given ninety thousand francs to something or
other,” cried the clerk, who had entirely confounded
the story of Fifi’s adventure, which had
been imparted to him in haste and confusion.</p>

<p>Fifi, nearly dying with laughter, rolled away in
her cab. The last glimpse she had of her late
friend, the bank clerk, he had found the basket in
the archway, and was declaiming with disheveled
hair and wild gesticulations concerning the robbery,
or the gift, he did not know which.</p>

<p>Fifi was not away from home more than half an
hour, and when Angéline, about one o’clock, passed
through the snuff-colored drawing-room, she saw
Fifi, through the open door, sitting at the writing-table
in her bedroom, and scribbling away for dear
life. This is what she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Cartouche: I have got your letter and I have
followed your advice&mdash;I will not say exactly how&mdash;but
you will shortly see me, I think, in the dear old
street of the Black Cat.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Fifi.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Madame Bourcet returned punctually at two
o’clock, and as the weather had become bad, she
and Fifi spent the afternoon together in the snuff-colored
drawing-room.</p>

<p>When eight o’clock in the evening arrived, Louis
Bourcet, as usual, appeared. He had news to communicate,
and gave a fearful and wonderful account
of the proceedings at the banking-house, in
which it was represented that a mysterious old lady,
with a basket and a limp, had appeared, and had
either stolen ninety thousand francs, or given
ninety thousand francs to the fund for the soldiers’
orphans, nobody outside of the bank knew exactly
which. The excitement in the neighborhood of the
bank had been tremendous, and such a crowd had
collected that the <i>gens d’armes</i> had been compelled
to charge in order to clear the street. The basket
had been found, but the limp, along with the old
lady, had vanished.</p>

<p>All sorts of stories were flying about concerning
the affair, some people declaring that the troops
from the nearest barracks had been ordered out, a
cordon placed around the banking-house, and the
mysterious old lady was nothing less than a determined
ruffian, who had disguised himself as an old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>woman, and was the leader of a gang of desperate
robbers, determined on looting the bank. Louis
Bourcet held firmly to this opinion.</p>

<p>“It is my belief,” he said solemnly, “that it was
a scheme which involved not only robbery, but possibly
assassination. The old woman was no old
woman, but a reckless criminal, who, by a clever
disguise, got into the bank, and was only prevented
from carrying out some dreadful design by
the coolness and decision of the bank employees.
The basket, which is marked with the initials A. D.,
is held at the bureau of the <i>arrondissement</i>, and at
the investigation to-morrow morning&mdash;mark my
words, that basket will be the means of disclosing
a terrible plot against the banking-house of Lafitte.”</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet listened to these words of wisdom
with the profoundest respect&mdash;but Fifi uttered
a convulsive sound which she smothered in her
handkerchief and which, she explained, was caused
by her agitation at the sensational story she had
just heard.</p>

<p>Louis was so flattered by the tribute of attention
to his powers of seeing farther into a
millstone than any one else, that he harangued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>the whole evening upon this violent attempt on
Lafitte’s banking-house in particular and the dangers
of robbery in general. He even forgot the
game of cribbage. When he rose to go, at ten
o’clock, both Madame Bourcet and Fifi protested
that they expected to be murdered in their beds
by a gang of robbers before daylight. Louis
promised to come to the <i>déjeuner</i> at eleven the next
morning, to give them the latest particulars of this
nefarious attempt to rob the bank.</p>

<p>Fifi alone in her own room went into spasms of
delight. Her freedom was close at hand&mdash;and soon,
soon, she could return to that happy life of hard
work and deep affection she had once known.
When she slipped into bed, the hard lump was not
in her mattress.</p>

<p>“Think,” she said to herself, lying awake in the
dark, “of the good that hateful money will do now&mdash;of
the poor children warmed and fed and clothed.
Giving it away like this is not half so difficult as
spending it on hats and gowns and monkeys, and
I think I may reckon on getting back to the dear
street of the Black Cat soon&mdash;very soon.”</p>

<p>And so, she fell into a deep, sweet sleep, to
dream of Cartouche, and Toto and all the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>at the Imperial Theater, including Julie Campionet.</p>

<p>Next morning, Fifi awaited the <i>déjeuner</i> with
feelings of entrancing pleasure. She loved to see
Louis Bourcet make a fool of himself, and longed
to make a fool of him&mdash;this naughty Fifi.</p>

<p>She was gratified, for at eleven o’clock, Louis
appeared, looking, for once, a little sheepish. The
desperate robbery had been no robbery at all, but
a gift of ninety thousand francs to the fund for
the soldiers’ orphans. Louis had bought several
newspapers, and each contained the official announcement
of the banking-house of Lafitte, with
a request that the generous donor come forward
and discover her identity.</p>

<p>Louis Bourcet, like a good many other people,
could always construct a new hypothesis to meet
any new development in a case. He at once declared
that the donor must be a conscience-stricken
woman, who had at some time committed a crime
and wished to atone for it. He harped on this
theme while Fifi was soberly drinking her chocolate
and inwardly quivering with delight. She
waited until one of Louis’s long-winded periods
came to an end, when, the spirit of the actress
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>within her, and the piercing joy of making Louis
Bourcet look like a guy, were too much for her.
Putting down her cup, therefore, and looking
about her in a way to command attention, Fifi
said, in a soft, low voice:</p>

<p>“Madame Bourcet&mdash;and dear Louis&mdash;” here
Louis shuddered&mdash;“I have something to say to you,
concerning that mysterious old woman with the
limp and the basket. First, let me say, that until
yesterday, I kept my fortune of nearly ninety
thousand francs in my mattress, and my old shoes
I kept in the bank. For people are always losing
their money in banks, but I never heard of any one
losing a franc that was sewed up in a mattress.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Louis Bourcet sat as if
turned to stone, with his chocolate raised to his lips,
and his mouth wide open to receive it, but he
seemed to lose the power of moving his hand
or shutting his mouth. Madame Bourcet appeared
to be paralyzed where she sat.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fifi, who felt as if she were once
more on the beloved boards of the Imperial Theater.
“I kept my money where I knew it would be
safe. And then, seeing I had totally failed to captivate
the affections of my fiancé, I determined to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>perform an act of splendid generosity, that would
compel his admiration, and possibly, his tenderness.
So, yesterday, when you, Madame, were out,
I dressed myself up in Angéline’s Sunday clothes,
took her small fruit basket, and putting all my
fortune in the basket, went to the bank, and handed
it all over, in notes of the Bank of France, to the
fund for soldiers’ orphans.”</p>

<p>There was not a sound, except Madame Bourcet’s
gasping for breath. Louis Bourcet had
turned of a sickly pallor, his mouth remaining
wide open, and his cup still suspended. This lasted
for a full minute, when the door suddenly opened,
and Angéline appeared from the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Madame,” she cried excitedly, “there have been
thieves here as well as at the bank. My fruit basket
is gone&mdash;I can swear I saw it yesterday morning.
It is marked with my initials, A. D., and I
trust, by the blessing of God, the thief will be
found and sent to the galleys for life.”</p>

<p>At this apparently trivial catastrophe, Madame
Bourcet uttered a loud shriek; Louis Bourcet
dropped his cup, which crashed upon the table,
smashing the water carafe; Angéline, amazed at
the result of her simple remark, ran wildly about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>the room shrieking, “Thieves! thieves! Send for
the police!” Madame Bourcet continued to emit
screams at short intervals, while Louis Bourcet,
his head in his hands, groaned in anguish.</p>

<p>Fifi, alone, sat serene and smiling, and as soon
as she could make herself heard, cried to Louis:</p>

<p>“Dear Louis, tell me, I beg of you, if you approve
of my course?”</p>

<p>“No!” bawled Louis, for once forgetting to be
correct in manner and deportment. Then, rising
to his feet, and staggering to the door, he said in
a sepulchral voice: “Everything is over between
us. If the Holy Father takes measures to make
me fulfil my compact to marry you, I shall leave
France&mdash;I shall flee my country. Mademoiselle,
permit me to say you are an impossible person.
Adieu forever, I hope!” With this he was gone.</p>

<p>Madame Bourcet at this recovered enough to
scream to Angéline, in a rapid crescendo:</p>

<p>“Get a van&mdash;<i>get a van</i>&mdash;<span class="allsmcap">GET A VAN</span>!”</p>

<p>Fifi knew perfectly well what that meant, and
was in ecstasies. She flew to her room, huddled
her belongings together, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“Cartouche, I shall see you! And, Cartouche, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>love you! And, Cartouche, I shall make you marry
me&mdash;me, your own Fifi!”</p>

<p>In a little while the van was at the door and
Fifi’s boxes were piled in. She threw to Angéline
the odious brown gown, with the green spots, and
a ten-franc piece besides&mdash;which somewhat mollified
Angéline, without changing her opinion that
Fifi was a dangerous and explosive person to have
about. She promised to send for the blue satin bed.
Then Fifi, reverting to her old natural self,
climbed into the van along with her boxes, and
jolted off, in the direction of the street of the
Black Cat, and was happier than she had yet been
since she had left it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">BACK TO THE BLACK CAT</span></h2></div>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon, the van,
containing Fifi and her wardrobe, drew up before
the tall old house in the street of the Black Cat
where she had lived ever since she was a little,
black-eyed child, who still cried for her mother,
and who would not be comforted except upon Cartouche’s
knee. How familiar, how actual, how delightfully
redolent of home was the narrow little
street! Fifi saw it in her mind’s eye long before
she reached it, and in her gladness of heart sang
snatches of songs like the one Toto thought was
made for him, <i>Le petit mousse noir</i>. As the van
clattered into the street, Fifi, sitting on her boxes,
craned her neck out to watch a certain garret window,
and from thence she heard two short, rapturous
barks. It was Toto. Fifi, jumping down,
opened the house door, and ran headlong up the
dark, narrow well-known stair. Half way up, she
met Toto, jumping down the steps two at a time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>Fifi caught him to her heart, and wept plentifully,
tears of joy.</p>

<p>But there was some one else to see&mdash;and that was
Cartouche, who was always in his room at that
hour.</p>

<p>“Now, Toto,” said Fifi, as she slipped softly up
the stairs, still squeezing him, “I am about to
make a formal offer of my hand to Cartouche;
and mind, you are not to interrupt me with barking
and whining and scratching. It is very awkward
to be interrupted on such occasions, and you
must behave yourself suitably to the situation.”</p>

<p>“Yap!” assented Toto.</p>

<p>The door to Cartouche’s room was a half-door,
the upper part of glass. This upper half-door
was a little ajar, and Fifi caught sight of Cartouche.
He was sitting on his poor bed, with a
large piece of tin before him, which he was transforming
into a medieval shield. He was hard at
work&mdash;for who ever saw Cartouche idle? But once
or twice he stopped, and picked up something lying
on the table before him, and looked at it. Fifi
recognized it at once. It was a little picture of
herself, taken long ago, when she used to sit on
Cartouche’s knee and beg him to tell her stories.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>Fifi felt a lump in her throat, and called out softly
and tremulously:</p>

<p>“Cartouche! I am here. It is Fifi.”</p>

<p>Cartouche dropped his tools as if lightning-struck,
and turned toward the door&mdash;and there was
Fifi’s smiling face peering at him.</p>

<p>He went straight to the door and opened the
upper part wide. Fifi saw that he was quite pale,
though his dark and expressive eyes were burning,
and it was plain to her that he was consumed
with love and longing for her&mdash;but he was almost
cross when he spoke.</p>

<p>“What brings you here, Fifi?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Everything that is good. First, Louis Bourcet
has jilted me&mdash;” and Fifi capered gleefully
with Toto in her arms.</p>

<p>“Is that anything to be merry about?” inquired
Cartouche, sternly; but Fifi saw that his strong
brown hand trembled as it lay on the sill of the
half-door.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is&mdash;if you knew Louis Bourcet&mdash;and
he did it because of my nobility of soul.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” said Cartouche.</p>

<p>“It was in this manner. You remember, Cartouche,
the letter you wrote me three days ago, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>which you advised me to give all my fortune to the
fund for soldiers’ orphans?”</p>

<p>“No,” tartly answered Cartouche. “I never
wrote you any such letter.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Fifi, sweetly, and taking from her
pocket Cartouche’s letter, she read aloud:</p>

<p>“‘You might follow the Empress’ example, and
going in your coach and six, with outriders, to the
banking-house of Lafitte, make a little gift of a
hundred thousand francs to the fund for the soldiers’
orphans.’</p>

<p>“I did not have a coach and six, with outriders,
nor even a hundred thousand francs to give,” continued
Fifi, putting the letter, for future reference,
in her pocket, “as I had spent almost ten thousand
on clothes and monkeys and beds. And I also
saved enough to buy some gowns that will put
Julie Campionet’s nose out of joint&mdash;but I had
nearly ninety thousand francs to give&mdash;and I
dressed myself up as an old woman&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was all over Paris this morning,” cried Cartouche,
striking his forehead, “I read it myself in
the newspaper! Oh, Fifi, Fifi, what madness!”
and Cartouche walked wildly about the room.</p>

<p>“Madness, do you call it?” replied Fifi, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>spirit. “This comes of taking your advice. I had
meant to spend the money on any foolish thing I
could find to buy that was worth nothing, and
never could be worth anything; and when your
letter came, I thought, ‘here is a sensible way to
spend it’&mdash;for I was obliged to get rid of it. I
never had a happy moment since I had the money&mdash;and
I must say, Cartouche, I think you behaved
very badly to me, in never making me the slightest
apology for giving me the ticket that drew the
money, even after you saw it made me miserable.”</p>

<p>Here Fifi assumed an offended air, to which Cartouche,
walking about distractedly, paid no attention
whatever, only crying out at intervals:</p>

<p>“Oh, Fifi, what makes you behave so! What will
you do now?”</p>

<p>Fifi drew off, now genuinely contemptuous and
indignant.</p>

<p>“Do?” she asked in a tone of icy contempt. “Do
you think that an actress who has given away her
whole fortune of ninety thousand francs and
whose grandfather was cousin to the Pope will
want an engagement?”</p>

<p>“But the newspapers don’t know who gave the
money,” said Cartouche, weakly. “All of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>this morning said that&mdash;and the Emperor has had
published in the <i>Moniteur</i> an official request that
the giver will make herself known, so that she may
receive the thanks in person of himself and the
Empress.”</p>

<p>“Better and better,” cried Fifi. “Ten francs the
week more will Duvernet have to pay me for receiving
the thanks of the Emperor and Empress.”
And then with an access of hauteur she added:
“You must know very little of the theatrical profession,
Cartouche, if you suppose I intend to let
the newspapers remain in ignorance of who gave
the money. Cartouche, in some respects, you know
about as little concerning our profession as the
next one. You never had the least idea of the value
of advertising.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied Cartouche, stung by her
tone, “all I know is, the value of hard work. And
now, I suppose, having thrown away the chance of
marrying a worthy man in a respectable walk of
life, you will proceed to marry some showy creature
for his fine clothes, or his long pedigree, and
then be miserable forever after.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Fifi, sweetly. “The man I
intend to marry is not at all showy. He is as plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>as the kitchen knife&mdash;and as for fine clothes and a
long pedigree, ha! ha!” Fifi pinched Toto, who
seemed to laugh with her.</p>

<p>Cartouche remained silent a whole minute, and
then said calmly:</p>

<p>“You seem to have fixed upon the man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Toto and I have agreed upon a suitable
match for me. Haven’t we, Toto?”</p>

<p>“Yap, yap, yap!” barked Toto.</p>

<p>“Have you consulted any one about this?” asked
Cartouche in a low voice, after a moment.</p>

<p>“No one but Toto,” replied Fifi, pinching Toto’s
ear.</p>

<p>Cartouche raised his arms in despair. He could
only groan:</p>

<p>“Oh, Fifi! Oh, Fifi!”</p>

<p>“Don’t ‘Oh Fifi’ me any more, Cartouche, after
your behavior to me,” cried Fifi indignantly, “and
after I have taken your advice and given the money
away, and Louis Bourcet has jilted me&mdash;as he did
as soon as he found I had no fortune&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you he would?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t need anybody to tell me that. Louis
Bourcet is one of the virtuous who make one sick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>of virtue. But at least after you made him jilt
me&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> made him jilt you!”</p>

<p>“Certainly you did. How many times shall I
have to prove to you that it was you who put it
into my head to give the money away? And now,
I want to ask, having caused me to lose the chance
of marrying the most correct young man in Paris,
you&mdash;you&mdash;ought to marry me yourself!”</p>

<p>Fifi said this last in a very low, sweet voice, her
cheek resting upon Toto’s sleek, black head, her
elbow on the sill of the half-door. Cartouche
walked quite to the other end of the room and
stood with his back to Fifi, and said not one word.</p>

<p>Fifi waited a minute or two, Cartouche maintaining
his strange silence. Then, Fifi, glancing
down, saw on a little table within the room, and
close to the half-door, a stick of chalk. With that
she wrote in large white letters on Toto’s black
back:</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><i>Cartouche, I love you</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="no-indent">and tossed Toto into the room. He trotted up to
Cartouche and lay down at his feet.</p>

<p>Fifi saw Cartouche give a great start when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>picked up the dog, and Toto uttered a little pleading
whine which was quite human in its entreaty.
Being a very astute dog, he knew that Cartouche
was not treating Fifi right, and so, pleaded for her.</p>

<p>Fifi, calmly watching Cartouche, saw that he
was deeply agitated, and she was not in the least
disturbed by it. Presently, dropping Toto, Cartouche
strode toward the half-door, over which Fifi
leaned.</p>

<p>“Fifi,” he cried, in a voice of agony, “why do
you torture me so? You know that I love you;
and you know that I ought not to let you marry
me&mdash;me, almost old enough to be your father,
poor, obscure, half crippled, Fifi. I shall never
forget the anguish of the first day I knew that I
loved you; it was the day I found you acting with
the players in the street. You were but sixteen,
and I had loved you until then as a child, as a little
sister&mdash;and suddenly, I was overwhelmed with a
lover’s love for you. But I swore to myself, on my
honor, never to let you know it&mdash;never to speak a
word of love to you&mdash;”</p>

<p>The strong man trembled, and fell, rather than
sat upon a chair. Fifi, trembling a little herself,
but still smiling, answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“And you have kept your vow. I remember that
day well&mdash;it was the first time you ever spoke an
angry word to me. You have spoken many since,
you hard-hearted Cartouche.”</p>

<p>To this Cartouche made no answer but to bury
his face in his lean, brown hands, that bore the
marks of honest toil. Fifi continued briskly:</p>

<p>“Cartouche, open this lower door. It is fast.”</p>

<p>Cartouche only shook his head.</p>

<p>Then Fifi, glancing about, saw a rickety old
chair at the head of the stairs, and noiselessly
fetching it, she put it against the door, stepped up
on it; a second step on the little table by the
door, and a third step on the floor, brought her in
the room, and close to Cartouche. She laid one
hand upon his shoulder&mdash;with the other she picked
up Toto&mdash;and said, in a wheedling voice:</p>

<p>“Cartouche, shall we be married this day fortnight?”</p>

<p>Cartouche made a faint effort to push her away,
but the passion in him rose up lion-like, and mastered
him. He seized Fifi in his strong arms and
devoured her rosy lips with kisses. Then, dropping
her as suddenly, he cried wildly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“No, no! It is not right, Fifi&mdash;I can not do you
so cruel a wrong!”</p>

<p>“You are almost as bad as Louis Bourcet,” remarked
Fifi, straightening her curly hair, which
was all over her face. “Nevertheless, I shall marry
you this day fortnight.”</p>

<p>For answer, Cartouche vaulted over the half-door,
in spite of his bad leg, and was gone clattering
down the stairs. Fifi listened as the sound died
away, and then ran to the window to see him go
out of the house and walk off, as fast as he could,
down the street of the Black Cat.</p>

<p>“Toto,” said Fifi to her friend, taking him up
in her arms: “We&mdash;you and I&mdash;are not good
enough for Cartouche, but all the same, we mean
to have him. I can not live without him&mdash;that is,
I will not, which comes to the same thing&mdash;and all
the other men I have ever known seem small and
mean alongside of Cartouche&mdash;” which showed that
Fifi, as she claimed, really had some sense.</p>

<p>As for Cartouche, he walked along through the
narrow streets into the crowded thoroughfare, full
of shadows even then, although it was still early in
the soft, spring afternoon. He neither knew nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>cared where he was going except that he must fly
from Fifi’s witching eyes and tender words and sweet
caresses. His heart was pounding so that he could
fancy others heard it besides himself. This marriage
was clearly impossible&mdash;it was not to be
thought of. Fifi, in spite of her rashness and
throwing away of her fortune, was no fool. She
had not, as Cartouche feared, assumed a style of
living that would have made a hundred thousand
francs a mere bagatelle. What she had squandered,
she had squandered deliberately for a purpose;
what she had given had been given to a good
cause, for Fifi, of all women, best knew her own
mind. And to think that she should have taken up
this strange notion to marry him&mdash;after she had
seen something so far superior&mdash;so Cartouche
thought. And what was to be done? If necessary,
he would leave the Imperial Theater, and go
far, far away; but what then would become of Fifi,
alone and unprotected, rash and young and beautiful?</p>

<p>Turning these things over tumultuously in his
mind, Cartouche found himself in front of the shop
where he had bought Fifi the red cloak. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>was a mirror in the window, and Cartouche stood
and looked at himself in it. The mirror stiffened
his resolution.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Fifi must not throw herself
away on such a looking fellow. I love her&mdash;I love
her too well for that.”</p>

<p>A church clock chimed six. Cartouche came out
of his troubled day-dream with a start&mdash;he was
already due at the theater. He ran as fast as his
bad leg would allow him, and for the first time in
the eight years he had been employed there, was
late.</p>

<p>Duvernet, the manager, was walking the floor of
his dingy little office and tearing his hair. He was
dressed for the part of the Cid Campeador in the
drama of the evening. Duvernet never made the
mistake of acting a trivial part. He clattered
about in a full suit of tin armor, but had inadvertently
clapped his hat on his head. Although there
was but little time to spare, the manager was
obliged to pour out his woes to Cartouche.</p>

<p>“Julie Campionet saw Fifi return, with all her
boxes,” he groaned; “and&mdash;well, you know Julie
Campionet&mdash;I have had the devil’s own time the
whole afternoon. Then Fifi marched herself over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>here&mdash;the minx. I called her Fifi, at first. She
drew herself up like an offended empress and said,
‘Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, if you please.’ She
then informed me, with an air of grand condescension
that she might return here as leading lady, and
told me, quite negligently, that she was the person
who gave the ninety thousand francs to the soldiers’
orphans’ fund. You would have thought she
was in the habit of giving ninety thousand francs
to charity every morning before breakfast. She
swore she did not intend to acknowledge it until
she had got a place as leading lady at a theater that
suited her; likewise that she proposed to be billed
as Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, cousin to the Holy
Father, and to have the story of her relationship to
the Pope published in every newspaper in Paris,
and demanded fifty francs the week. The advertising
alone is worth a hundred francs the week; but
you know, Cartouche, no woman on earth could
stand a hundred francs the week and keep sane.
Then, she tells me that she has a magnificent wardrobe&mdash;she
wore that brooch in here, which I have
never been able to satisfy myself is real or not&mdash;and
took such a high tone altogether that I began
to ask myself if I were the manager of this theater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>or was Fifi. And then the last information she
gave me was that she was to marry you this day
fortnight&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Cartouche, gloomily.</p>

<p>“And said if I didn’t give her back her old place
as leading lady that I would have to part with you.
I said something about Julie Campionet, and being
my wife, and so on, and then Fifi flew into a
royal rage, saying she would settle with Julie
Campionet herself. Then Julie came rushing into
the room, and she and Fifi had it out in great style.
You never heard such a noise in your life&mdash;it was
like killing pigs, and Julie fell in my arms and
screamed to me to protect her, and Fifi started that
infernal dog of hers to barking, and there was a
devil of a row, and how it ended I don’t know, except
that both of them are vowing vengeance on
me. But one thing is sure&mdash;I can’t let a chance go
of securing the Pope’s cousin, who won the first
prize in the lottery and gave away ninety thousand
francs. And then&mdash;what Julie&mdash;”</p>

<p>The manager groaned and buried his head in his
hands. Like the unfortunate Louis Bourcet, all
he could make out was, that whatever he did would
be highly imprudent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>It was already late, and there was not another
moment to lose, so Cartouche had to run away and
leave the manager to his misery.</p>

<p>The performance was hardly up to the mark
that night. Sensational tales of Fifi’s return had
flown like wildfire about the theater. She was commonly
reported to have come back in a coach and
pair, with a van full of huge boxes, all crammed
with the most superb costumes. Such stories were
naturally disquieting to Julie Campionet, and together
with her scene in the afternoon, impaired her
performance visibly.</p>

<p>As for Fifi, she was at that moment established
in her old room, which luckily was vacant, and was
cooking a pair of pork chops over a charcoal stove&mdash;and
was perfectly happy. So was Toto, who
barked vociferously, and had to be held in Fifi’s
arms, to keep his paws off the red-hot stove. There
was a bottle of wine, some sausages, and onions and
cheese, and a box of highly colored bonbons, for
which Fifi had rashly expended three francs. But
it is not every day, thought Fifi, that one comes
home to one’s best beloved&mdash;and so she made a little
feast for Cartouche and herself.</p>

<p>Cartouche was late that night, and trying to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>avoid Fifi, he mounted softly to his garret. As he
approached Fifi’s door, he saw the light through a
chink. Fifi heard his step, quiet as it was, and
opening the door wide, cried out gaily:</p>

<p>“Here is supper ready for you, Cartouche, and
Toto and I waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Cartouche could not resist. He had meant to&mdash;but
after all, he was but human&mdash;and Fifi was so
sweet&mdash;so sweet to him. He came in, therefore,
awkwardly enough, and feeling like a villain the
while, he sat down at the rickety little table, on
which Fifi had spread a feast, seasoned with love.</p>

<p>“Cartouche,” she said presently, when they were
eating and drinking, “you must get a holiday for
this day fortnight.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Cartouche, gnawing his
chop&mdash;Fifi cooked chops beautifully.</p>

<p>“Because that is the day we are to be married,”
briskly responded Fifi.</p>

<p>Cartouche put down his chop.</p>

<p>“Fifi,” he said. “You will break my heart. Why
will you persist in throwing yourself away on me?”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Fifi to Toto, “how very silly
Cartouche is to-night! And what a horrid fiancé
he makes&mdash;worse than Louis Bourcet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Then Fifi told him about some of the tricks she
had played on poor Louis, and Cartouche was
obliged to laugh.</p>

<p>“At least, Fifi,” he said, “you shan’t marry me,
until you have consulted his Holiness.”</p>

<p>“And his Majesty,” replied Fifi gravely. “Who
would think, to see us supping on pork chops and
onions, that our marriage concerned such very
great people!”</p>

<p>Cartouche went to his garret presently, still
drowned in perplexities, but with a wild feeling of
rapture that seemed to make a new heaven and a
new earth for him.</p>

<p>Fifi, next morning, proceeded to lay out her
plans. She did not go near the theater until the
afternoon. Then she put on her yellow and purple
brocade, her large red and green satin cloak,
her huge hat and feathers and reinforced with the
alleged diamond brooch, and sending out for a cab,
ordered it to carry her and her magnificence across
the street to the manager’s private office.</p>

<p>Duvernet, thinking Fifi had come to her senses,
and would ask, instead of demanding, her place
back, received her coolly. Fifi was charmingly
affable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“I only called to ask, Monsieur,” she said, “if
you could tell me how to catch the diligence which
goes out to Fontainebleau. I wish to go out to
see his Holiness, who, as you know, is my relative,
and as such, I desire his formal consent to my
marriage to Cartouche.”</p>

<p>Fifi was careful not to say that she was the
Pope’s relative; the Pope was <i>her</i> relative.</p>

<p>Duvernet, somewhat disconcerted by Fifi’s superb
air, replied that the diligence passed the corner,
two streets below, at nine in the morning, and one
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” responded Fifi. “I shall go out,
to-morrow, at one o’clock. I could not think of
getting up at the unearthly hour necessary to take
the morning diligence. And can you tell me, Monsieur,
about the omnibus that passes the Tuileries?
The Emperor has had a request printed in the <i>Moniteur</i>,
asking that the lady who made the gift of
ninety thousand francs to the soldiers’ orphans
should declare herself&mdash;and I have no objection to
going in the omnibus as far as the gates of the
Tuileries. Then, I shall get a carriage.”</p>

<p>Duvernet was so thunderstruck at Fifi’s grandeur,
that he mumbled something quite unintelligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
about the omnibus. Fifi, however, was perfectly
well acquainted with the ways both of the
omnibus and diligence, and only inquired about
them to impress upon Duvernet the immense gulf
between the Fifi of yesterday and the Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti of to-day. She finally rose and sailed
off, but returned to ask the amazed and disgusted
Duvernet to get her a cab to take her across the
street.</p>

<p>“I can walk, Monsieur,” she said condescendingly,
“except that I am afraid of ruining my
clothes. I carry on my back nearly four thousand
francs’ worth of clothes.”</p>

<p>Duvernet, still staggered by her splendors, had
to search the neighborhood for a cab&mdash;cabs were
not much in demand in that quarter. But at last
he found one, which transported Fifi and her
grandeur across the way. It was clearly impossible
that so much elegance should go on foot.</p>

<p>That night, again, she made a little supper for
Cartouche, and Cartouche, feeling himself a guilty
wretch, again went in and ate it, and basked in the
sunlight of Fifi’s eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE POPE WINS</span></h2></div>

<p>Now, Fifi really intended to go out to Fontainebleau
the next day to see the Holy Father, for,
although she cared little for the opinion of the
world in general, she had been deeply impressed
by the benignant old man, and she secretly
yearned for his approval. And besides, she had
an instinctive feeling that the Holy Father would
understand better than any one else in the world
why she wished to marry Cartouche. That tender,
serene soul of the old man, who cherished the affections
of his youth and who had sounded the depths
and measured the heights of human grandeur and
yet esteemed love the greatest thing in the world,
would understand a simple, loving heart like Fifi’s.
It had been so easy to tell him all about Cartouche
and herself&mdash;and he had comprehended it so readily;
just the same, thought Fifi, as if he himself
had lived and worked and struggled as she and
Cartouche had lived and worked and struggled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>Fifi knew, in her own way, that there is a kinship
among all honest souls&mdash;and that thus the Holy
Father was near of kin to Cartouche.</p>

<p>Fifi did not mention this proposed expedition to
Cartouche, because, in her lexicon, it was always
easier to justify a thing after it is done than before.</p>

<p>So, when on the morning after her return, the
diligence rumbled past the street below that of the
Black Cat, Fifi was inside the diligence&mdash;and, on
the outside, quite unknown to her, was Duvernet.</p>

<p>The manager, it may be imagined, had not had
a very easy time of it, either as a manager or a
husband for the last twenty-four hours. Julie
Campionet had large lung power, and had used it
cruelly on him. Nevertheless, the idea of securing
Fifi with all her additional values for the Imperial
Theater was quite irresistible to Duvernet; and the
thought that another manager, more enterprising
than he, might get her for ten francs more the
week, was intolerable to him. He determined to
make a gigantic effort for Fifi’s services, and it
would be extremely desirable to him to have this
crucial interview as far away from the Imperial
Theater as possible.</p>

<p>Therefore, Duvernet was on the lookout when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>the diligence jolted past, and when he saw a demure
figure in black, with a veil over her face, get inside
the diligence, he recognized Fifi, and jumped up
on the outside.</p>

<p>Fifi, sitting within, had no notion that Duvernet
was on the same vehicle. She kept her veil down
and behaved with the greatest propriety. She
knew better than to wear any of her ridiculous
finery in the presence of the Holy Father, and as
she had got rid of the brown gown with the green
spots, she wore a plain black gown and mantle
which became her well, and she scarcely seemed
like the same creature who had worn the yellow
brocade robe and the striped satin cloak.</p>

<p>The diligence rumbled along, through the pleasant
spring afternoon, upon the sunny road to
Fontainebleau, and reached it in a couple of hours.</p>

<p>When Fifi dismounted, at the street leading to
the palace, what was her surprise to find that
Duvernet dismounted too!</p>

<p>“I had business at Fontainebleau, and so was
fortunate to find myself on the top of the diligence,
while you were inside,” was Duvernet’s ready explanation
of his presence.</p>

<p>Fifi was at heart glad of his protection, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>hoped he would return to Paris with her, but
would by no means admit so much to him.</p>

<p>“I,” said Fifi, with dignity, “also have business
at Fontainebleau&mdash;with the Holy Father. You
may walk with me to the palace.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mademoiselle,” answered Duvernet,
bowing; and Fifi could not tell whether he
was laughing at her or not.</p>

<p>As they walked toward the vast old palace, gray
and peaceful in the golden sun of springtime, Duvernet
said:</p>

<p>“Well, Fi&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Fifi coldly.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I should say. Since we find ourselves
together, we may as well resume our business
conversation of yesterday afternoon. If you will
take fifty francs the week, your old place at the
Imperial Theater is open to you.”</p>

<p>“And that minx, Julie Campionet&mdash;oh, I beg
your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” gloomily replied Julie Campionet’s
husband. “She has told me twenty times
since yesterday that she means to get a divorce,
just like the others. If she doesn’t, I can, perhaps,
get her to take her old parts by giving her an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>additional five francs the week&mdash;for I assure you,
when it comes to a question of salary, she is not
Madame Duvernet, but Julie Campionet.”</p>

<p>“It would be against my conscience, Monsieur,
to interfere with your domestic peace&mdash;” said Fifi
demurely, and that time it was Duvernet who didn’t
know whether or not Fifi was laughing at him.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” replied he, with his loftiest air,
“do you suppose I would let my domestic peace
stand before Art? No. A thousand times no! Art
is always first with me, and last. And besides, if
Julie Campionet should get a divorce from me&mdash;well,
I have never found any trouble yet in getting
married. All the trouble came afterward.”</p>

<p>“Fifty francs,” mused Fifi; “and if I allow you
to bill me as Mademoiselle Chiaramonti, and the
granddaughter of the Pope’s cousin, that would be
worth at least twenty-five francs the week more.
Seventy-five francs the week.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Good heavens, no!” shouted Duvernet. “The
Holy Father himself wouldn’t be worth seventy-five
francs at the Imperial Theater! Sixty francs,
at the outside, and Julie Campionet to think it is
fifty.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="350" alt="Fifi and Duvernet at Fontainebleu."
title=""  /></div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“I had better wait until I am married to Cartouche,”
replied Fifi innocently.</p>

<p>But waiting was just what the manager did not
want. So, still urging her to take sixty francs,
they reached the palace.</p>

<p>Fifi had a little note prepared and gave it, together
with a pink gilt-bordered card, inscribed
“Mademoiselle Josephine Chiaramonti,” to the porter
at the door. The porter evidently regarded
Fifi, and her note and card included, with the utmost
disfavor, but, like most underlings, he was
well acquainted with his master’s private affairs,
and knew in a minute who Fifi was, and so, grudgingly
went off with her letter and card.</p>

<p>Fifi and Duvernet kept up their argument in the
great, gloomy anteroom into which they were ushered.
Fifi was saying:</p>

<p>“And if I allow you to bill me as his Holiness’
cousin, and you give me seventy-five francs&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sixty, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five francs, will you promise always to
take my part when I quarrel with Julie Campionet?”</p>

<p>“Good God! What a proposition! I am married
to Julie Campionet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Have you really and actually straightened out
your divorces from your other three wives?” asked
Fifi maliciously.</p>

<p>“N-n-not exactly. To tell you the truth, Fi&mdash;I
mean, Mademoiselle&mdash;I get those divorce suits and
those leading ladies so mixed up in my head, that
I am not quite sure about anything concerning
them. But if you doubt that I am married to Julie
Campionet, just listen to her when she is giving
me a wigging, and you will be convinced.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” continued Fifi, dismissing Duvernet
and Julie Campionet and their matrimonial complications
with a wave of the hand, “it is not really
necessary for me to act at all. I have a fortune in
my diamond brooch, any time I choose to sell it.
I gave away ninety thousand francs&mdash;but in my
brooch I hold on to enough to keep the wolf from
the door.” Then, a dazzling <i>coup</i> coming into her
head, she remarked casually, “I hope Cartouche is
not marrying me for my diamond brooch.”</p>

<p>Duvernet, a good deal exasperated by Fifi’s airs,
replied, with a grin:</p>

<p>“Cartouche tells me he isn’t going to marry you
at all.”</p>

<p>“We will see about that,” said Fifi, using the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>same enigmatic words Cartouche had used, when
the matrimonial proposition was first offered for
his consideration.</p>

<p>After a long wait the porter returned, accompanied
by the same sour-looking ecclesiastic whom
Fifi had met on her previous visit; and he escorted
her to the door of the Pope’s chamber.</p>

<p>The door was opened for her, and Fifi found
herself once more in the presence of the Pope. She
ran forward and kissed his hand, and the Holy
Father patted her hand kindly.</p>

<p>“Well, my child,” he said, “I hear strange things
of you. The Bourcets conveyed to me early
this morning that you have left their house, given
up the marriage with the respectable young advocate,
Louis Bourcet, and bestowed all your fortune
on charity. I have been anxious about you.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t be so any more, Holy Father,” said
Fifi, smiling brightly and seating herself on a
little chair the Holy Father motioned her to take.
“I never was so happy in my life as I am now. I
hated the idea of marrying Louis Bourcet.”</p>

<p>“Then you should not have agreed to marry
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Holy Father, you can’t imagine how it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>dazes one to be suddenly overwhelmed with riches,
to be taken away from all one knows and loves, to
be compelled to be idle when one would work&mdash;to
be, in short, transplanted to another world. At
first, I would have agreed to anything.”</p>

<p>“I understand. Now, open your heart to me as
to your father.”</p>

<p>“I was very wretched after I got the money. I
was idle, I was unhappy, I was unloved&mdash;and I had
been used to being busy, to being happy, to being
loved. And what gave me the courage to rebel was,
that I found out I loved Cartouche. Holy Father,
he is my only friend&mdash;” An expression in the Holy
Father’s eyes made Fifi quickly correct herself.
“<i>Was</i> my only friend. And when I thought of
being married, I could not imagine life without
Cartouche. So, I made up my mind to marry him.
But Cartouche said he was neither young nor rich,
nor handsome, and with my youth and newly-acquired
fortune, I ought to marry above him. I
do not claim that Cartouche is what is called&mdash;a&mdash;”
Fifi hesitated, the term “brilliant marriage” not
being known in the street of the Black Cat. But
the Holy Father suggested it with a smile&mdash;</p>

<p>“A brilliant marriage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father, that is what I mean. But he
is the best of men; I shiver when I think what
would have become of me without Cartouche. And
he is as brave as a lion&mdash;he was the first man across
at the bridge of Lodi&mdash;and the Emperor was the
second. And he serves Duvernet, the manager, just
as faithfully as he served his country. Cartouche
has charge of all sorts of things at the theater, and
he would die rather than let any one swindle the
manager.”</p>

<p>“I should like to have him for my majordomo,”
said the Holy Father.</p>

<p>“He is not much of an actor though, to say
nothing of his stiff leg. Cartouche is an angel,
Holy Father, but he can not act. So he does not
get much salary&mdash;only twenty-five francs the week.
However, I know two things: that Cartouche is
the best of men, and that I love him with all my
heart. Holy Father, was not that reason enough
for not marrying Louis Bourcet?”</p>

<p>“Quite reason enough,” softly answered the
Holy Father.</p>

<p>“After all, though, it was Louis Bourcet who
got rid of me. It was like this, Holy Father. I
knew as long as I had a hundred thousand francs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>that Louis Bourcet would marry me, no matter how
outlandish my behavior was; and I also knew, as
long as I had a hundred thousand francs, Cartouche
never would marry me. And as I wanted to be
happy, I concluded to get rid of my hundred thousand
francs, and that horrid, pious, correct, stupid,
pompous Louis Bourcet at the same time&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then Fifi burst into the whole story of her
adventures, beginning with her putting the box of
old shoes in the bank, and sewing her money up in
the mattress. Through it all the Holy Father sat
with his hand to his lips and coughed occasionally.</p>

<p>Fifi knew how to tell her story, and gave very
graphic pictures of her life and adventures in
the Rue de l’Echelle. She told it all, including
her return to the street of the Black Cat in the
same van with her boxes, her proposal of marriage
to Cartouche and Toto’s share in the proceedings.
The Holy Father listened attentively, and after an
extra spell of coughing at the end, inquired
gravely:</p>

<p>“And what did Cartouche say to your proposition
to marry him?”</p>

<p>“Holy Father, he behaved horridly, and has not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>yet agreed, although the poor fellow is eating his
heart out for me. He says still, I am far above
him&mdash;for, you see, Holy Father, as soon as I have
it published that I am the giver of ninety thousand
francs to the orphans’ fund, all Paris will flock to
see me act&mdash;and then&mdash;I shall be billed as Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti&mdash;cousin of the Holy Father,
the Pope. That alone is worth twenty-five francs
the week extra.”</p>

<p>A crash resounded. The Holy Father’s footstool
had tumbled over noisily. The Holy Father
himself was staring in consternation at Fifi.</p>

<p>“On the bills, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father. On the big red and blue
posters all over the quarter of Paris.”</p>

<p>“It must not be,” said the Holy Father, with a
quiet firmness that impressed Fifi very much.
“How much did you say it was worth?”</p>

<p>“I say twenty-five francs. Duvernet, the manager,
says only fifteen.”</p>

<p>“Where is this Duvernet?”</p>

<p>“Waiting for me in the anteroom below, Holy
Father. He came out to Fontainebleau to try to
get me to make the arrangement at once.”</p>

<p>The Pope touched a bell at hand, and a servant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>appeared, who was directed to bring Manager Duvernet
to him at once. Then, turning to Fifi, he
said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Duvernet must give up all ideas of
this outrageous playbill&mdash;and in consideration, I
will secure to you an annuity of twenty-five francs
the week as long as you live.”</p>

<p>“How good it is of you, Holy Father!” cried
Fifi. Then she added dolefully: “But I am afraid
if Cartouche knows I am to be as rich as that, I
shall have more trouble than ever getting him to
marry me. What shall I do, Holy Father, about
telling him?”</p>

<p>The Pope reflected a moment or two.</p>

<p>“It is a difficult situation, but it must be managed,”
he answered.</p>

<p>Then Fifi, eager for the Holy Father’s approval
of Cartouche, told many stories of his goodness to
her in her childish days&mdash;and presently Duvernet
was announced.</p>

<p>Duvernet was an earnest worshiper of titles and
power, but not to the extent of forgetting his own
advantage; and, although on greeting the Pope he
knelt reverently, he rose up with the fixed determination
not to do anything against the interests of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>the Imperial Theater, or its manager, not if the
Pope and all the College of Cardinals united in
asking him.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said the Holy Father, gently, but
with authority: “This young relative of mine tells
me that her salary is to be increased fifteen francs
the week at your theater if her name and relationship
to me shall be exploited. I offer her twenty-five
francs the week if she will forego this. It does
not appear to me to be proper that such exploitation
should take place.”</p>

<p>Duvernet bowed to the ground.</p>

<p>“Holy Father,” said he, with deepest humility,
“it rests with Mademoiselle Chiaramonti.” And he
whispered to Fifi behind his hand, “Thirty francs.”</p>

<p>“Thirty francs!” cried Fifi indignantly, “only
just now you were telling me that it was not even
worth twenty-five francs!”</p>

<p>The Holy Father’s voice was heard&mdash;gentle as
ever&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thirty-five francs.”</p>

<p>Duvernet, being found out, and seeing that he
had the Supreme Pontiff on the other side of the
market, concluded it was no time for diffidence, so
he cried out boldly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Thirty-eight francs.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Fifi looked toward the Holy
Father.</p>

<p>“Forty francs,” said the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Duvernet, with the air and manner of a Roman
senator acknowledging defeat, bowed superbly and
said:</p>

<p>“Your Holiness wins,” and backed toward the
door.</p>

<p>Fifi turned to the Pope, and said with shining
eyes:</p>

<p>“Holy Father, I thank you more than I can ever,
ever say&mdash;I promise never to do anything to dishonor
the name I bear. And Duvernet,” she added,
turning to where the manager stood with folded
arms and the expression of a martyr: “Recollect,
even if it is not put on the bill that I am the granddaughter
of the Holy Father’s cousin, that I am
still valuable. Did I not win the first prize in the
lottery? And did I not give ninety thousand
francs to the soldiers’ orphans? And shan’t I be
thanked in person by the Emperor and Empress?
Match me that if you can. And besides, have I
not the finest diamond brooch in Paris?”</p>

<p>“If it is diamond,” said Duvernet under his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>breath, but not so low that the Holy Father did
not hear him. However, without noticing this,
the Pope asked of him:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, will you kindly give me your opinion
of Monsieur Cartouche, whom my young relative
wishes to marry?”</p>

<p>Duvernet paused a minute, trying to find words
to express what he thought of Cartouche, but in
the end could only say:</p>

<p>“Your Holiness, Cartouche is&mdash;well, I could not
conduct the Imperial Theater without Cartouche.
And he is the most honest and the most industrious
man I ever saw in my life.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Monsieur. Good afternoon,” said
the Pope, and Duvernet vanished.</p>

<p>“My child,” said the Holy Father, after a little
pause: “What is this about your having the finest
diamond brooch in Paris?” As he spoke, the Holy
Father’s face grew anxious. The possession of fine
diamonds by a girl of Fifi’s condition was a little
disquieting to him.</p>

<p>“It is only paste, Holy Father,” replied Fifi,
whipping the brooch out of her pocket. “I always
carry it with me to make believe it is diamond, but
it is no more diamond than my shoe. Duvernet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>thinks it is diamond, and I encouraged him to
think so, because I found that it always overawed
him. Whenever he grew presumptuous, all I had
to do was to put on this great dazzling brooch
and a very grand air, and it brought him down at
once.”</p>

<p>“My child,” said the Holy Father&mdash;and stopped.</p>

<p>“I know what you would say, Holy Father&mdash;I
am deceiving Duvernet&mdash;but that is what is called
in the world&mdash;diplomacy.”</p>

<p>With that she handed the brooch to the Holy
Father. It was a brazen imposture, and the Pope,
who knew something about gems, could but smile at
the size and impudence of the alleged stones.</p>

<p>Then Fifi said timidly:</p>

<p>“Holy Father, how about Cartouche? I so
much want to marry Cartouche!”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the Pope calmly, “you can not do
better than marry Cartouche, for I am sure he is
an honest fellow, and loves you, and you must bring
him out to see me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Holy Father,” cried Fifi joyfully, “when I
bring Cartouche out to see you, you will see what a
<i>very</i> honest, kind man he is! But you must not
expect to see a fine gentleman. My Cartouche has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>the heart and the manners of a gentleman, but he
has not the clothes of a gentleman.” And to this,
the Pope replied, smiling:</p>

<p>“The time has been when I was a poor parish
priest, that I had not the clothes of a gentleman,
so I can feel for your Cartouche. So now, farewell,
and be a good child&mdash;and forty francs the
week as long as you are simply Mademoiselle Fifi.
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Holy Father, and I can not thank you
enough, and I am the happiest creature in the
world.”</p>

<p>And then Fifi fell on her knees, and received a
tender blessing, and went away, thinking with pride
and joy of the visit she was to make after she was
married to Cartouche.</p>

<p>“I know the Holy Father will like him,” she
thought, as she tripped along the grand avenue
toward the town. “The Holy Father is kind and
simple of heart, and honest and brave, and so is
Cartouche, and each will know this of the other, so
how can they help being satisfied each with the
other?”</p>

<p>Thinking these thoughts she almost walked over
Duvernet, who was proceeding in the same direction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>Duvernet’s manner had undergone a complete
change in the last half-hour, and he spoke to Fifi
with an offhandedness which took no account of her
ruffled feathers when he addressed her by her first
name.</p>

<p>“Fifi,” said Duvernet, “for it is all nonsense to
call you Mademoiselle Chiaramonti now&mdash;Fifi, I
say, I will give you fifty francs the week on the
strength of having drawn the first prize in the lottery,
of having given your fortune to the soldiers’
orphans and of being thanked, as you will be, by
the Emperor and Empress in person. It is a liberal
offer. No other manager in Paris would do so
well.”</p>

<p>“And my art?” asked Fifi, grandly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, your art is well enough, as long as I
have Cartouche to manage you. With the Pope’s
forty francs the week you will be the richest woman
in our profession on the left bank of the Seine.”</p>

<p>Fifi considered a while, walking briskly along.
Ninety francs the week! What stupendous wealth!
But it would never do to yield at once.</p>

<p>“And I am to have all of Julie Campionet’s best
parts? And you are to be on my side in all my
quarrels with Julie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Duvernet. “You don’t suppose
I would stand on a little thing like that? Now,
you had better take what I offer you, or Julie will
certainly spread the report that you wished to come
back to the Imperial Theater and I would not let
you.”</p>

<p>“Bring the contract to me this evening,” replied
Fifi.</p>

<p>“And to-morrow it is to be published in the newspapers?”</p>

<p>“Of course. In all the newspapers. But, Monsieur,
there are some things you must not expect of
me now as formerly, such as constructing togas
for you out of my white petticoats, and making
wigs for you out of tow. I am above that now.”</p>

<p>“So I see&mdash;for the present&mdash;” replied Duvernet,
laughing disrespectfully, “but just let Julie Campionet
try her hand at that sort of thing in your
place, and you would burst if you did not outdo
her. Come, here is the diligence. In with you.”</p>

<p>Fifi got back to her old quarters in time to prepare
supper again for Cartouche. This time they
had cabbage-soup and a bit of sausage.</p>

<p>Poor Cartouche, who had alternated between
heaven and hell ever since Fifi’s return, was in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>heaven, sitting opposite to her at the rickety table,
and eating Fifi’s excellent cabbage-soup. She herself
fully appreciated their menu.</p>

<p>“When I was with the Bourcets I could not eat
their tasteless messes,” she cried. “No garlic, no
cabbage, very few onions&mdash;and everything sickly
sweet. No, Cartouche, one must live as one has
lived, and one must have a husband who likes the
same things one likes, so that is why I am marrying
you a week from Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Fifi,” said Cartouche, trying to be stern,
“haven’t I told you to put that silly idea out of
your head?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I haven’t though, and to-day I went
to Fontainebleau to see the Holy Father, and&mdash;now
listen to reason, Cartouche&mdash;he told me to marry
you. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>This was the first Cartouche had heard of the
visit to Fontainebleau. Fifi described it glibly, and
if she represented the Holy Father as urging and
commanding her marriage to Cartouche much more
strongly than was actually the case, it must be set
down to her artistic instinct which made her give
the scene its full dramatic value. When she paused
for breath, Cartouche said, glumly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“But the Holy Father hasn’t seen me and my
stiff leg yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Fifi, “I am to take you out to Fontainebleau
as soon as we are married.”</p>

<p>“You are afraid to show me before we are married.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I told the Holy Father that
you were neither young nor handsome; for that
matter, the Holy Father himself is neither young
nor handsome. But I am glad you have at last
agreed that we are to be married&mdash;not that it would
make any difference.”</p>

<p>“You have not married me yet,” Cartouche weakly
protested, gazing into the heaven of Fifi’s eyes,
while eating her delicious cabbage-soup.</p>

<p>“Have you no respect for the Holy Father?”
asked Fifi, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose the Holy Father to-day had
advised you to marry some one&mdash;some one else&mdash;Louis
Bourcet, for example.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have paid the least attention to him;
but it is your duty, Cartouche, when the Holy
Father says you ought to marry me to do so without
grumbling.”</p>

<p>And with this masterly logic, Fifi helped herself
to the last of the soup.</p>

<p>The next day but one, the mystery was solved
of the old lady who gave the ninety thousand francs
to the soldiers’ orphans’ fund. It was not an old
lady at all, but the young and pretty actress, Mademoiselle
Fifi, who had drawn the great prize in the
lottery. She had temporarily retired from the
stage of the Imperial Theater, in the street of the
Black Cat, but would shortly resume her place
there as leading lady. So it was printed in the
newspapers, and known in the salons of Paris.</p>

<p>There was very nearly a mob in the street of the
Black Cat, so many persons were drawn by curiosity
to see Fifi. Fifi, peeping from her garret window,
would have dearly liked to exhibit herself, but
Duvernet, for once stern, refused to let her show
so much as an eyelash, except to those who bought
a ticket to see her at the theater, when she was to
appear in her great part of the Roman maiden on
the Thursday week, the very day she had fixed upon
to marry Cartouche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>In this determination to keep Fifi in seclusion
until the night of her reappearance on the stage,
Duvernet was backed up by Cartouche, who reminded
Fifi of the enormous salary she was receiving
of fifty francs the week. He had no inkling
of the further rise in her fortunes of forty
francs the week from the Holy Father.</p>

<p>Meanwhile rehearsals were actively begun, and
Fifi had had the exquisite joy of seeing that Julie
Campionet was furiously jealous of her. Duvernet,
in spite of his unceremonious behavior to her in private,
treated her at rehearsals with a respect fitting
the place she held on the programme and the stupendous
salary she received. All of her fellow actors
were either stand-offish with her or over-friendly,
but this, Fifi knew, was only a phase. Cartouche
alone treated her as he had always done, and even
scolded her sharply, saying that in three months
she had forgotten what it had taken her three years
to learn. But this was hardly exact, for Fifi, being
a natural actress, had forgotten very little and
had learned a great deal during her exile from the
Imperial Theater.</p>

<p>On the morning after the announcement made in
the newspapers about Fifi’s gift a great clatter was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>heard in the street of the Black Cat. An imperial
courier came riding to Fifi’s door and handed in a
letter with the imperial arms and seal. It was a
notification that the next day, at noon, an imperial
carriage would be sent for her that she might go
to the Tuileries and be thanked personally by the
Emperor and Empress for her magnificent generosity
to the soldiers’ orphans.</p>

<p>Fifi turned pale as she read this letter. She did
not mind the Emperor, but the Empress. And
what should she wear?</p>

<p>While considering these momentous questions,
Duvernet rushed into the room. He had seen the
courier and suspected his errand.</p>

<p>Fifi, with blanched lips, told him. Duvernet
was nearly mad with joy.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he cried. “If I was not already married
to Julie Campionet and three other women I would
marry you this moment, Fifi.”</p>

<p>“Marry me!” cried Fifi, turning crimson, and
finding her voice, which rose with every word she
uttered. “Marry <i>me</i>! <i>You</i>, Duvernet! Marry
Mademoiselle Josephine Chiaramonti! No! A
thousand times no! Julie Campionet is good
enough for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“I am as good as Cartouche,” growled Duvernet,
stung by this vicious attack on himself and his
wife.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Duvernet,” screamed Fifi, stamping
her foot, “if you wish me to appear at the Imperial
Theater a week from Thursday you will at once
admit that Julie Campionet is good enough for you,
and that I&mdash;I am far too good for you&mdash;but not
too good for Cartouche.”</p>

<p>Duvernet hesitated, but the manager in him came
uppermost. He conceded all that Fifi claimed, but
on returning to the theater cuffed the call-boy unmercifully
by way of reprisal on somebody, after
Fifi’s exasperating behavior.</p>

<p>That night, at supper, Cartouche was oppressed
and depressed by this new honor awaiting Fifi.
Presently he said to her seriously:</p>

<p>“Fifi, it’s out of the question&mdash;your marrying
me. Why, you might marry an officer&mdash;who
knows? Now, Fifi, don’t be a fool and insist on
marrying me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be a fool,” answered Fifi promptly,
“and I will marry you. The Holy Father told me
to, and I expect the Emperor will do the same. At
all events, you, too, are to go to the Tuileries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“I!”</p>

<p>Cartouche fell back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I could never get along without
you.”</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t go in the coach with you.”</p>

<p>“No. You can be in the gardens, though, and
if the Emperor wants you he can send for you.”</p>

<p>Cartouche in the end concluded he might as well
go, not that he expected the Emperor to send for
him, but simply because Fifi wished him to go. And
he decided a very important point for Fifi&mdash;what
she should wear.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t wear any of your wild hats, or that
yellow gown, which can be heard screaming a mile
away. Remember, the Emperor is not a Duvernet,
and the Empress is not Julie Campionet. Wear
your little black bonnet, with your black gown and
mantle, and you will look like what you are&mdash;my
sweet little Fifi.”</p>

<p>This was the first word of open lovemaking into
which Cartouche had suffered himself to be betrayed,
and as soon as he had uttered it he jumped
up from the supper table and ran to his own garret
as quickly as his stiff leg would allow. Fifi
caught Toto to her heart in lieu of Cartouche and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>murmured, “He loves me! He loves me! He loves
me!”</p>

<p>At noon, next day, a splendid imperial carriage
drove into the street of the Black Cat and stopped
before Fifi’s door. Fifi, dressed modestly and becomingly
in black, appeared. She could not forbear
carrying her huge muff, but as it was the fashion
it did not detract from the propriety of her appearance.</p>

<p>The street was full when, assisted by a gorgeous
footman, she took her seat in the carriage.
Duvernet was a rapturous spectator of
Fifi’s splendor, and she had the ecstasy of feeling
that Julie Campionet was watching the whole magnificent
event.</p>

<p>She sat up very straight as she drove through
the bright and sunny streets toward the Tuileries.
As she entered the great gates she watched for
Cartouche, who was to be there. Yes, there he was,
looking out for her. Fifi’s heart gave a great throb
of relief, for she was really frightened half to
death, and the nearness of Cartouche made her feel
a little safer. The look in his face as their eyes
met was full of encouragement&mdash;it did not seem
to him a dreadful thing at all to meet the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>This courage of Fifi’s only lasted until the carriage
door was opened, and she had to alight and
walk an interminable distance through miles of gorgeous
rooms, of mirrors, of paintings, of gilding,
and, worse than all, in the company of the very
polite old gentleman-in-waiting who escorted her.</p>

<p>She knew not how she found herself in a small
boudoir, and presently the door opened and the
Emperor and Empress entered, and at the first
word spoken to her by the Emperor, as with the
Holy Father, fear instantly departed from her, and
it seemed the most natural thing in the world for
her to be there.</p>

<p>Fifi made a very pretty bow to both the Emperor
and Empress. The Empress seated herself, and
her kind eyes, her soft Creole voice, her charming
grace, captivated Fifi, as it had done many of the
greatest of the earth. But when the Emperor
spoke&mdash;ah, Fifi was one of the people, after all&mdash;and
like the old moustaches in Cartouche’s regiment,
she would have died for the Emperor after
having once seen him. He said to her:</p>

<p>“The Empress and I wish to thank you for your
splendid gift to the soldiers’ orphans, Mademoiselle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>Was it not your whole fortune? For I remember
well hearing that you had drawn the grand prize
in the lottery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sire,” replied Fifi, “but I am still well
off.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“Sire, the manager of the Imperial Theater is to
give me fifty francs the week, and the Holy Father,
to whom my grandfather was cousin, is to give me
forty francs the week as long as I live; that is, if
I do not put it on the bill-boards that I am Mademoiselle
Chiaramonti, granddaughter of the Pope’s
cousin.”</p>

<p>“It was I who caused that relationship to be
established, after having heard your name, the evening
that my good friend Cartouche invited me to
see you act. But what ingenious person was it
who dreamed of putting your relationship to the
Pope on the bill-boards?”</p>

<p>“I and our manager, Monsieur Duvernet, Sire.
Monsieur Duvernet knows how to advertise.”</p>

<p>The Emperor laughed a little.</p>

<p>“I should think so. I have met Monsieur Duvernet&mdash;the
same evening, Mademoiselle, that I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>the pleasure of seeing you act. So the Holy
Father interfered with yours and Duvernet’s little
plan&mdash;ha! ha!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sire. First, Monsieur Duvernet said he
would give me twenty francs to be billed as the
Pope’s cousin, and the Holy Father said he would
give me twenty-five francs to be billed simply as
Mademoiselle Fifi. Then Monsieur Duvernet said
thirty francs, and the Holy Father said thirty-five;
and Monsieur Duvernet said thirty-eight, and
the Holy Father said forty. That was such a large
sum, Sire, that Monsieur Duvernet could not meet
it.”</p>

<p>“And what does our friend Cartouche say to
this? Cartouche,” he explained to the Empress, “is
my old friend of Lodi, the only man who crossed
the bridge before me, and he came to see me and
consulted me about this young lady’s fortune.”</p>

<p>“Cartouche, Sire, does not know it.”</p>

<p>“Why? Have you fallen out with Cartouche?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Sire. Cartouche and I are to be married
a week from Thursday,” replied Fifi, smiling and
blushing.</p>

<p>“Then explain why he does not know about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>Pope’s forty francs, since you are to marry him
so soon?”</p>

<p>“Because, Sire, Cartouche does not want to
marry me&mdash;I mean, that is, he thinks he is not
young enough or rich enough or well-born enough
for me&mdash;which is all nonsense, Sire.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I know something about you and Cartouche.”</p>

<p>“And I never could have married him if I had
not got rid of my money. But I am afraid if
Cartouche knows of my forty francs the week he
will make a difficulty.”</p>

<p>“In that case we must not let him know anything
about it. But I was told by my arch-treasurer
Lebrun that a marriage had been arranged for you
with a young advocate here whom Lebrun knows
well, by name Bourcet. What becomes of that?”</p>

<p>Fifi smiled and blushed more than ever, and remained
silent until the Empress said, in her flute-like
voice:</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Mademoiselle, you could not love
him.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I hated him,” answered Fifi, with
the greatest earnestness. “He was the most correct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>person and the greatest bore in the universe. Unlike
Cartouche, he thought himself much too good
for me, but was willing to take me on account of
my hundred thousand francs. At first I tried to
frighten him off.”</p>

<p>“How, Mademoiselle?” asked the Emperor, now
laughing outright.</p>

<p>“Sire, by&mdash;by&mdash;buying things. Dreadful
clothes, and&mdash;and&mdash;monkeys, but I was afraid of
the monkeys and would not keep them&mdash;and a blue
satin bed made for the Empress&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I know that diabolical bed&mdash;so they swindled
you into buying it?”</p>

<p>“No, Sire, it was only a way of squandering
money and frightening that ridiculous Louis Bourcet.
And&mdash;I made love to him very outrageously&mdash;which
was nearly the death of him. Louis Bourcet
is not the sort of a man to be first across the
bridge of Lodi. The only way to have got him
across would have been to carry him. But in spite
of all I could do he would have married me if I had
not found a way to get rid of my money.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how you contrived to get your money in
your own hands?”</p>

<p>Then Fifi told about putting the box of old shoes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>in the bank and sewing the money up in the mattress,
just as she had told the Pope, and both the
Emperor and the Empress laughed aloud at it.
And Fifi further explained how Cartouche’s letter
had showed her the way to make a good use of her
uncomfortable fortune instead of merely throwing
it away.</p>

<p>The Empress then asked, in her charming manner,
some questions about Fifi’s life, and both the
Emperor and Empress seemed excessively amused
at the simplicity of Fifi’s answer.</p>

<p>“I shall have to tell Lebrun, the arch-treasurer,
about this,” cried the Emperor; “and now, what
can I or the Empress do for you?”</p>

<p>Fifi reflected a moment.</p>

<p>“If you please, Sire,” she replied after a moment,
“to send for Cartouche&mdash;he is just outside in the
gardens&mdash;and order him to marry me a week from
next Thursday. For, if he should happen to find
out that I have forty francs the week as long as I
live, there’s no telling what he will do, unless your
Majesty gives him positive orders.”</p>

<p>The Emperor rang, and his aide appearing, he
was directed to find the fellow named Cartouche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“He is very homely and has a stiff leg,” said
Fifi, by way of description of her lover.</p>

<p>While Cartouche was being found, the Emperor,
after his wont, began to ask Fifi all manner of
questions, especially about the Holy Father, and
listened attentively to her replies. His only comment
was:</p>

<p>“A good old man, a dreamer, who lives in his
affections.”</p>

<p>When Cartouche was ushered into the room the
Empress spoke to him with the greatest kindness,
but the Emperor, frowning, said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Fifi tells me she has a mind to
marry you a week from Thursday, and you are
hanging back.”</p>

<p>“Sire,” replied Cartouche, respectfully, but without
the least fear, “I am too old and ugly for Fifi,
and I have a stiff leg. Your Majesty knows what
I say is true.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“No, I do not know it, and Cartouche, obey what
I say to you. A week from Thursday, or before,
if Mademoiselle Fifi requires, you are to be ready
to marry her, and if you balk the least in the world
I shall have a sergeant and a file of soldiers to
persuade you. Do you understand?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_234.jpg" width="350" alt="Fifi and Cartouche with Napoleon and Josephine."
title=""  /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p class="p2">“Oh, Sire,” replied Cartouche, with shining eyes,
“how good of your Majesty to command me! For,
otherwise, I never could have thought it anything
but wrong to tie Fifi to me for life. But one must
obey the Emperor.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Fifi, quite forgetting herself in her
joy, “one must obey the Emperor.”</p>

<p>And then the Emperor kissed Fifi on the cheek,
and pulled Cartouche’s ear, saying to him:</p>

<p>“You mutinous rascal, you would disobey your
Emperor; but remember the sergeant and the file of
soldiers are ready when Mademoiselle Fifi calls for
them. So, good by, and good fortune to you both,
and if anything befalls you, you know where to
find your Emperor.”</p>

<p>The Empress gave Fifi her hand to kiss and said,
smiling:</p>

<p>“I shall not forget a little present for your wedding,”
and Fifi and Cartouche went away, the two
happiest creatures in Paris.</p>

<p>Fifi returned in the imperial carriage, and Cartouche
returned on the top of an omnibus, but each
of them was in a heaven of his own.</p>

<p>Fifi reached home first, and when Cartouche arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
she was hard at work on a white bonnet for
her wedding.</p>

<p>“Cartouche,” she cried, as he opened the door,
“there are a million things to be done if we are to
be married a week from next Thursday.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Cartouche, “and Fifi&mdash;you
need not send for the sergeant, I think.”</p>

<p>Fifi threw herself into his arms. She was bubbling
over with joy. Cartouche’s saturnine face
was more saturnine than ever. He kissed Fifi solemnly,
and broke away from her. It was too much
joy for him.</p>

<p>The preparations for their wedding were simple
enough, as became an insignificant actress and a
poor actor, whose home was to be in two little rooms
very high up; for Fifi, having been bred under the
tiles, declined to come down lower, in spite of her
improved fortunes. They had a great many rehearsals
at the theater, too, and Cartouche, as stage
manager, had lost none of his strictness, and ordered
Fifi about as peremptorily as if he were not
to be married to her on Thursday. Fifi obeyed
him very sweetly and had a new humility toward
him.</p>

<p>All of their fellow actors showed them great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>good-will&mdash;even Julie Campionet, who behaved in
the most beautiful manner, considering what provocation
Fifi had long given her. Everybody connected
with the theater gave them a little present&mdash;poor
and cheap enough, but rich in kindness. Even
the old woman who lighted the theater brought Fifi
a couple of pink candles for a wedding present,
and Fifi thankfully accepted them.</p>

<p>Two days before the wedding came three splendid
presents&mdash;a fine shawl from the Empress, a
watch from the Emperor and a purse from the
Holy Father. Fifi was charmed, and took up so
much time at rehearsal in exhibiting these gorgeous
gifts that she failed to answer her cue, and subjected
herself to a fine, according to the rules of
the theater, which Cartouche rigorously exacted.</p>

<p>Fifi worked so hard preparing for her wedding
on the Thursday morning, and her return to the
stage on the Thursday evening, that the hours flew
as if on wings&mdash;and the day came almost before
she knew it.</p>

<p>The morning was fair and bright as only
May mornings can be fair and bright. Fifi and
Cartouche, with Duvernet and Julie Campionet,
now completely reconciled with Fifi for a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>time, walked to the <i>mairie</i> and then to the parish
church, and were married hard and fast. From
thence they went to a cheap café to breakfast, and
Duvernet, in honor of the occasion, had a two-franc
bouquet of violets on the table. All of the
waiters knew that two of the party were bride and
groom, but Cartouche was so solemn and silent, and
Duvernet so gay and talkative, that everybody supposed
Duvernet the happy man and Cartouche the
disappointed suitor.</p>

<p>It was then time for the rehearsal, which lasted
nearly all the rest of the day, Cartouche being unusually
strict. When the curtain went up in the
evening never was there such an audience or so
much money in the Imperial Theater. The best
seats were put at the unprecedented price of two
francs and a half, and Duvernet gnashed his teeth
that he had not made them three francs, so great
was the crowd. The play was the famous classical
one in which Duvernet had worn the toga made of
Fifi’s white petticoat. This time he had a beautiful
toga, bought at a sale of third and fourth-hand
theatrical wardrobes, and it had been washed
by Julie Campionet’s own hands.</p>

<p>Everybody in the cast made a success. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>Cartouche as the wounded Roman centurion of the
Pretorian Guard, got several recalls, and he was
no great things of an actor. Duvernet covered
himself with glory, but all paled before Fifi’s triumph.
Never was there such a thunder of applause,
such a tempest of curtain calls, such a storm
of bravos. Fifi palpitated with joy and pride.</p>

<p>When at last the performance was over, and Cartouche
and Fifi came out of the theater into the
dark street, under the quiet stars, Fifi said, quite
seriously:</p>

<p>“Cartouche, my heart is troubled.”</p>

<p>“Why, Fifi?”</p>

<p>“Because I am not half good enough for you.
I am only Fifi&mdash;you know what I mean. I am
ashamed that I am not something more and better
than merely Fifi.”</p>

<p>And Cartouche, who was usually the most matter-of-fact
fellow alive, replied softly:</p>

<p>“As if a rose should be ashamed of being only a
rose!”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
